<h2>THE RELIGION OF ANCIENT ROME</h2>

<h3>CHAPTER I<span class="totoc"><a href="#toc">ToC</a></span></h3>

<h4>INTRODUCTION&mdash;SOURCES AND SCOPE</h4>
<br />

<p>The conditions of our knowledge of the native religion of early Rome
may perhaps be best illustrated by a parallel from Roman arch&aelig;ology.
The visitor to the Roman Forum at the present day, if he wishes to
reconstruct in imagination the Forum of the early Republic, must not
merely 'think away' many strata of later buildings, but, we are told,
must picture to himself a totally different orientation of the whole:
the upper layer of remains, which he sees before him, is for his
purpose in most cases not merely useless, but positively misleading.
In the same way, if we wish to form a picture of the genuine Roman
religion, we cannot find it immediately in classical literature; we
must banish from our minds all that is due to the contact with the
East and Egypt, and even with the other races of Italy, <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span>and we must
imagine, so to speak, a totally different mental orientation before
the great influx of Greek literature and Greek thought, which gave an
entirely new turn to Roman ideas in general, and in particular
revolutionised religion by the introduction of anthropomorphic notions
and sensuous representations. But in this difficult search we are not
left without indications to guide us. In the writings of the savants
of the late Republic and of the Empire, and in the Augustan poets,
biassed though they are in their interpretations by Greek tendencies,
there is embodied a great wealth of ancient custom and ritual, which
becomes significant when we have once got the clue to its meaning.
More direct evidence is afforded by a large body of inscriptions and
monuments, and above all by the surviving Calendars of the Roman
festival year, which give us the true outline of the ceremonial
observances of the early religion.</p>

<p>It is not within the scope of this sketch to enter, except by way of
occasional illustration, into the process of interpretation by which
the patient work of scholars has disentangled the form and spirit of
the native religion from the mass of foreign accretions. I intend
rather to assume the process, and deal, as far as it is <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span>possible in
so controversial a subject, with results upon which authorities are
generally agreed. Neither will any attempt be made to follow the
development which the early religion underwent in later periods, when
foreign elements were added and foreign ideas altered and remoulded
the old tradition. We must confine ourselves to a single epoch, in
which the native Roman spirit worked out unaided the ideas inherited
from half-civilised ancestors, and formed that body of belief and
ritual, which was always, at least officially, the kernel of Roman
religion, and constituted what the Romans themselves&mdash;staunch
believers in their own traditional history&mdash;loved to describe as the
'Religion of Numa.' We must discover, as far as we can, how far its
inherited notions ran parallel with those of other primitive
religions, but more especially we must try to note what is
characteristically Roman alike in custom and ritual and in the motives
and spirit which prompted them.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER II<span class="totoc"><a href="#toc">ToC</a></span></h3>

<h4>THE 'ANTECEDENTS' OF ROMAN RELIGION</h4>
<br />


<p>In every early religion there will of course be found, apart from
external influence, traces of its own internal development, of stages
by which it must have advanced from a mass of vague and primitive
belief and custom to the organised worship of a civilised community.
The religion of Rome is no exception to this rule; we can detect in
its later practice evidences of primitive notions and habits which it
had in common with other semi-barbarous peoples, and we shall see that
the leading idea in its theology is but a characteristically Roman
development of a marked feature in most early religions.</p>

<p><b>1. Magic.</b>&mdash;Anthropology has taught us that in many primitive
societies religion&mdash;a sense of man's dependence on a power higher than
himself&mdash;is preceded by a stage of magic&mdash;a belief in man's own power
to influence by occult means the action of the world around him. That
the <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>ancestors of the Roman community passed through this stage seems
clear, and in surviving religious practice we may discover evidence of
such magic in various forms. There is, for instance, what anthropology
describes as 'sympathetic magic'&mdash;the attempt to influence the powers
of nature by an imitation of the process which it is desired that they
should perform. Of this we have a characteristic example in the
ceremony of the <i>aquaelicium</i>, designed to produce rain after a long
drought. In classical times the ceremony consisted in a procession
headed by the pontifices, which bore the sacred rain-stone from its
resting-place by the Porta Capena to the Capitol, where offerings were
made to the sky-deity, Iuppiter, but<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> from the analogy of other
primitive cults and the sacred title of the stone (<i>lapis manalis</i>),
it is practically certain that the original ritual was the purely
imitative process of pouring water over the stone. A similar
rain-charm may possibly be seen in the curious ritual of the <i>argeorum
sacra</i>, when puppets of straw were thrown into the Tiber&mdash;a symbolic
wetting of the crops to which many parallels may be found among other
primitive peoples. A sympathetic charm of a rather <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>different
character seems to survive in the ceremony of the <i>augurium canarium</i>,
at which a red dog was sacrificed for the prosperity of the crop&mdash;a
symbolic killing of the red mildew (<i>robigo</i>); and again the slaughter
of pregnant cows at the <i>Fordicidia</i> in the middle of April, before
the sprouting of the corn, has a clearly sympathetic connection with
the fertility of the earth. Another prominent survival&mdash;equally
characteristic of primitive peoples&mdash;is the sacredness which attaches
to the person of the priest-king, so that his every act or word may
have a magic significance or effect. This is reflected generally in
the Roman priesthood, but especially in the ceremonial surrounding the
<i>flamen Dialis</i>, the priest of Iuppiter. He must appear always in
festival garb, fire may never be taken from his hearth but for sacred
purposes, no other person may ever sleep in his bed, the cuttings of
his hair and nails must be preserved and buried beneath an <i>arbor
felix</i>&mdash;no doubt a magic charm for fertility&mdash;he must not eat or even
mention a goat or a bean, or other objects of an unlucky character.</p>

<p><b>2. Worship of Natural Objects.</b>&mdash;A very common feature in the early
development of religious consciousness is the worship of natural
objects&mdash;in the first place of the objects <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>themselves and no more,
but later of a spirit indwelling in them. The distinction is no doubt
in individual cases a difficult one to make, and we find that among
the Romans the earlier worship of the object tends to give way to the
cult of the inhabiting spirit, but examples may be found which seem to
belong to the earlier stage. We have, for instance, the sacred stone
(<i>silex</i>) which was preserved in the temple of Iuppiter on the
Capitol, and was brought out to play a prominent part in the ceremony
of treaty-making. The fetial, who on that occasion represented the
Roman people, at the solemn moment of the oath-taking, struck the
sacrificial pig with the <i>silex</i>, saying as he did so, 'Do thou,
Diespiter, strike the Roman people as I strike this pig here to-day,
and strike them the more, as thou art greater and stronger.' Here no
doubt the underlying notion is not merely symbolical, but in origin
the stone is itself the god, an idea which later religion expressed in
the cult-title specially used in this connection, <i>Iuppiter Lapis</i>. So
again, in all probability, the <i>termini</i> or boundary-stones between
properties are in origin the objects&mdash;though later only the site&mdash;of a
yearly ritual at the festival of the Terminalia on February the 23rd,
and they are, as it were, summed up in 'the <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>god Terminus,' the great
sacred boundary-stone, which had its own shrine within the Capitoline
temple, because, according to the legend, 'the god' refused to budge
even to make room for Iuppiter. The same notion is most likely at the
root of the two great domestic cults of Vesta, 'the hearth,' and
Ianus, 'the door,' though a more spiritual idea was soon associated
with them; we may notice too in this connection the worship of
springs, summed up in the subsequent deity Fons, and of rivers, such
as Volturnus, the cult-name of the Tiber.</p>

<p><b>3. Worship of Trees.</b>&mdash;But most conspicuous among the cults of
natural objects, as in so many primitive religions, is the worship of
trees. Here, though doubtless at first the tree was itself the object
of veneration, surviving instances seem rather to belong to the later
period when it was regarded as the abode of the spirit. We may
recognise a case of this sort in the <i>ficus Ruminalis</i>, once the
recipient of worship, though later legend, which preferred to find an
historical or mythical explanation of cults, looked upon it as sacred
because it was the scene of the suckling of Romulus and Remus by the
wolf. Another fig-tree with a similar history is the <i>caprificus</i> of
the Campus Martius, subsequently the site of the worship of Iuno
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>Caprotina. A more significant case is the sacred oak of Iuppiter
Feretrius on the Capitol, on which the <i>spolia opima</i> were hung after
the triumph&mdash;probably in early times a dedication of the booty to the
spirit inhabiting the tree. Outside Rome, showing the same ideas at
work among neighbouring peoples, was the 'golden bough' in the grove
of Diana at Aricia. Nor was it only special trees which were thus
regarded as the home of a deity; the tree in general is sacred, and
any one may chance to be inhabited by a spirit. The feeling of the
country population on this point comes out clearly in the prayer which
Cato recommends his farmer to use before making a clearing in a wood:
'Be thou god or goddess, to whom this grove is sacred, be it granted
to us to make propitiatory sacrifice to thee with a pig for the
clearing of this sacred spot'; here we have a clear instance of the
tree regarded as the dwelling of the sacred power, and it is
interesting to compare the many similar examples which<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> Dr. Frazer
has collected from different parts of the world.</p>

<p><b>4. Worship of Animals.</b>&mdash;Of the worship of animals we have
comparatively little evidence in Roman religion, though we may perhaps
detect it in a portion of the mysterious ritual of the <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>Lupercalia,
where the Luperci dressed themselves in the skins of the sacrificed
goats and smeared their faces with the blood, thus symbolically trying
to bring themselves into communion with the sacred animal. We may
recognise it too in the association of particular animals with
divinities, such as the sacred wolf and woodpecker of Mars, but on the
whole we may doubt whether the worship of animals ever played so
prominent a part in Roman religion as the cult of other natural
objects.</p>

<p><b>5. Animism.</b>&mdash;Such are some of the survivals of very early stages of
religious custom which still kept their place in the developed
religion of Rome, but by far the most important element in it, which
might indeed be described as its 'immediate antecedent,' is the state
of religious feeling to which anthropologists have given the name of
'Animism.' As far as we can follow the development of early religions,
this attitude of mind seems to be the direct outcome of the failure of
magic. Primitive man begins to see that neither he nor his magicians
really possess that occult control over the forces of nature which was
the supposed basis of magic: the charm fails, the spell does not
produce the rain and when he looks for the cause, he can only argue
that these things must <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>be in the hands of some power higher than his
own. The world then and its various familiar objects become for him
peopled with spirits, like in character to men, but more powerful, and
his success in life and its various operations depends on the degree
in which he is able to propitiate these spirits and secure their
co-operation. If he desires rain, he must win the favour of the spirit
who controls it, if he would fell a tree and suffer no harm, he must
by suitable offerings entice the indwelling spirit to leave it. His
'theology' in this stage is the knowledge of the various spirits and
their dwellings, his ritual the due performance of sacrifice for
purposes of propitiation and expiation. It was in this state of
religious feeling that the ancestors of Rome must have lived before
they founded their agricultural settlement on the Palatine: we must
try now to see how far it had retained this character and what
developments it had undergone when it had crystallised into the
'Religion of Numa.'</p>

<h3>CHAPTER III<span class="totoc"><a href="#toc">ToC</a></span></h3>

<h4>MAIN FEATURES OF THE RELIGION OF NUMA</h4>
<br />

<p><b>1. Theology.</b>&mdash;The characteristic appellation of a divine spirit in
the oldest stratum of the Roman religion is not <i>deus</i>, a god, but
rather <i>numen</i>, a power: he becomes <i>deus</i> when he obtains a name, and
so is on the way to acquiring a definite personality, but in origin he
is simply the 'spirit' of the 'animistic' period, and retains
something of the spirit's characteristics. Thus among the divinities
of the household we shall see later that the Genius and even the Lar
Familiaris, though they attained great dignity of conception, and were
the centre of the family life, and to some extent of the family
morality, never quite rose to the position of full-grown gods; while
among the spirits of the field the wildness and impishness of
character associated with Faunus and his companion Inuus&mdash;almost the
cobolds or hobgoblins of the flocks&mdash;reflects clearly the old
'animistic' belief in the natural evilness of <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>the spirits and their
hostility to men. The notion of the <i>numen</i> is always vague and
indefinite: even its sex may be uncertain. 'Be thou god or goddess' is
the form of address in the farmer's prayer already quoted from Cato:
'be it male or female' is the constant formula in liturgies and even
dedicatory inscriptions of a much later period.</p>

<p>These spirits are, as we have seen, indwellers in the objects of
nature and controllers of the phenomena of nature: but to the Roman
they were more. Not merely did they inhabit places and things, but
they presided over each phase of natural development, each state or
action in the life of man. Varro, for instance, gives us a list of the
deities concerned in the early life of the child, which, though it
bears the marks of priestly elaboration, may yet be taken as typical
of the feeling of the normal Roman family. There is Vaticanus, who
opens the child's mouth to cry, Cunina, who guards his cradle, Edulia
and Potina, who teach him to eat and drink, Statilinus, who helps him
to stand up, Adeona and Abeona, who watch over his first footstep, and
many others each with his special province of protection or
assistance. The farmer similarly is in the hands of a whole host of
divinities who <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>assist him at each stage of ploughing, hoeing, sowing,
reaping, and so forth. If the <i>numen</i> then lacks personal
individuality, he has a very distinct specialisation of function, and
if man's appeal to the divinity is to be successful, he must be very
careful to make it in the right quarter: it was a stock joke in Roman
comedy to make a character 'ask for water from Liber, or wine from the
nymphs.' Hence we find in the prayer formul&aelig; in Cato and elsewhere the
most careful precautions to prevent the accidental omission of the
deity concerned: usually the worshipper will go through the whole list
of the gods who may be thought to have power in the special
circumstances; sometimes he will conclude his prayer with the formula
'whosoever thou art,' or 'and any other name by which thou mayest
desire to be called.' The <i>numen</i> is thus vague in his conception but
specialised in his function, and so later on, when certain deities
have acquired definite names and become prominent above the rest, the
worshipper in appealing to them will add a cult-title, to indicate the
special character in which he wishes the deity to hear: the woman in
childbirth will appeal to Iuno Lucina, the general praying for victory
to Iuppiter Victor, the man who is taking an oath to Iuppiter <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>as the
deus Fidius. As a still later development the cult-title will, as it
were, break off and set up for itself, usually in the form of an
abstract personification: Iuppiter, in the two special capacities just
noted, gives birth to Victoria and Fides.</p>

<p>The conception of the <i>numen</i> being so formless and indefinite, it is
not surprising that in the genuine Roman religion there should have
been no anthropomorphic representations of the divinity at all. 'For
170 years,' Varro tells us, taking his date from the traditional
foundation of the city in 754 <span class="fakesc">B.C.</span>, 'the Romans worshipped
their gods without images,' and he adds the characteristic comment,
'those who introduced representations among the nations, took away
fear and brought in falsehood.' Symbols of a few deities were no doubt
recognised: we have noticed already the <i>silex</i> of Iuppiter and the
boundary-stone of Terminus, which were probably at an earlier period
themselves objects of worship, and to these we may add the sacred
spears of Mars, and the <i>sigilla</i> of the State-Penates. But for the
most part the <i>numina</i> were without even such symbolic representation,
nor till about the end of the regal period was any form of temple
built for them to dwell in. The sacred fire of Vesta near the <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>Forum
was, it is true, from the earliest times enclosed in a building; this,
however, was no temple, but merely an erection with the essentially
practical purpose of preventing the extinction of the fire by rain.
The first temple in the full sense of the word was according to
tradition built by Servius Tullius to Diana on the Aventine: the
tradition is significant, for Diana was not one of the <i>di indigetes</i>,
the old deities of the 'Religion of Numa,' but was introduced from the
neighbouring town of Aricia, and the attribution to Servius Tullius
nearly always denotes an Etruscan<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> or at any rate a non-Roman
origin. There were, however, altars in special places to particular
deities, built sometimes of stone, sometimes in a more homely manner
of earth or sods. We hear for instance of the altar of Mars in the
Campus Martius, of Quirinus on the Quirinal, of Saturnus at the foot
of the Capitol, and notably of the curious underground altar of Consus
on what was later the site of the Circus Maximus. But more
characteristic than the erection of altars is the connection of
deities with special localities. Naturally enough in the worship of
the household Vesta had her seat at the hearth, Ianus <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>at the door,
and the 'gods of the storehouse' (<i>Penates</i>) at the cupboard by the
hearth, but the same idea appears too in the state-cult. Hilltops,
groves, and especially clearings in groves (<i>luci</i>) are the most usual
sacred localities. Thus Quirinus has his own sacred hill, Iuppiter is
worshipped on the Capitol, Vesta and Iuno Lucina have their sacred
groves within the boundaries of the city, and Dea Dia, Robigus, and
Furrina similar groves at the limits of Roman territory. The record of
almost every Roman cult reveals the importance of locality in
connection with the <i>di indigetes</i>, and the localities are usually
such as would be naturally chosen by a pastoral and agricultural
people.</p>

<p>Such were roughly the main outlines of the genuine Roman 'theology.'
It has no gods of human form with human relations to one another,
interested in the life of men and capable of the deepest passions of
hatred and affection towards them, such as we meet, for instance, in
the mythology of Greece, but only these impersonal individualities, if
we may so call them, capable of no relation to one another, but able
to bring good or ill to men, localised usually in their habitations,
but requiring no artificial dwelling or elaborate adornment of their
abode; becoming <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>gradually more and more specialised in function, yet
gaining thereby no more real protective care for their worshippers&mdash;a
cold and heartless hierarchy, ready to exact their due, but incapable
of inspiring devotion or enthusiasm. Let us ask next how the Romans
conceived of their own relations towards them.</p>

<p><b>2. The Relation of Gods and Men.</b>&mdash;The character of the Roman was
essentially practical and his natural mental attitude that of the
lawyer. And so in his relation towards the divine beings whom he
worshipped there was little of sentiment or affection: all must be
regulated by clearly understood principles and carried out with formal
exactness. Hence the <i>ius sacrum</i>, the body of rights and duties in
the matter of religion, is regarded as a department of the <i>ius
publicum</i>, the fundamental constitution of the state, and it is
significant, as Marquardt has observed, that it was Numa, a king and
lawgiver, and not a prophet or a poet, who was looked upon as the
founder of the Roman religion. Starting from the simple general
feeling of a dependence on a higher power (<i>religio</i>), which is common
to all religions, the Roman gives it his own characteristic colour
when he conceives of that dependence as <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>analogous to a civil contract
between man and god. Both sides are under obligation to fulfil their
part: if a god answers a man's prayer, he must be repaid by a
thank-offering: if the man has fulfilled 'his bounden duty and
service,' the god must make his return: if he does not, either the
cause lies in an unconscious failure on the human side to carry out
the exact letter of the law, or else, if the god has really broken his
contract, he has, as it were, put himself out of court and the man may
seek aid elsewhere. In this notion we have the secret of Rome's
readiness under stress of circumstances, when all appeals to the old
gods have failed, to adopt foreign deities and cults in the hope of a
greater measure of success.</p>

<p>The contract-notion may perhaps appear more clearly if we consider one
or two of the normal religious acts of the Roman individual or state.
Take first of all the performance of the regular sacrifices or acts of
worship ordained by the state-calendar or the celebration of the
household <i>sacra</i>. The <i>pietas</i> of man consists in their due
fulfilment, but he may through negligence omit them or make a mistake
in the ritual to be employed. In that case the gods, as it were, have
the upper hand in the contract and are not obliged to fulfil <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>their
share, but the man can set himself right again by the offering of a
<i>piaculum</i>, which may take the form either of an additional sacrifice
or a repetition of the original rite. So, for instance, when Cato is
giving his farmer directions for the lustration of his fields, he
supplies him at the end with two significant formul&aelig;: 'if,' he says,
'you have failed in any respect with regard to all your offerings, use
this formula: "Father Mars, if thou hast not found satisfaction in my
former offering of pig, sheep, and ox (the most solemn combination in
rustic sacrifices), then let this offering of pig and sheep and ox
appease thee": but if you have made a mistake in one or two only of
your offerings, then say, "Father Mars, because thou hast not found
satisfaction in that pig (or whatever it may be), let this pig appease
thee."' On the other hand, for intentional neglect, there was no
remedy: the man was <i>impius</i> and it rested with the gods to punish him
as they liked (<i>deorum iniuriae dis curae</i>).</p>

<p>But apart from the regularly constituted ceremonies of religion, there
might be special occasions on which new relations would be entered
into between god and man. Sometimes the initiative would come from
man: desiring to obtain from <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>the gods some blessings on which he had
set his heart, he would enter into a <i>votum</i>, a special contract by
which he undertook to perform certain acts or make certain sacrifices,
in case of the fulfilment of his desire. The whole proceeding is
strictly legal: from the moment when he makes his vow the man is <i>voti
reus</i>, in the same position, that is, as the defendant in a case whose
decision is still pending; as soon as the gods have accomplished their
side of the contract he is <i>voti damnatus</i>, condemned, as it were, to
damages, having lost his suit; nor does he recover his independence
until he has paid what he undertook: <i>votum reddidi lubens merito</i> ('I
have paid my vow gladly as it was due') is the characteristic wording
of votive inscriptions. If the gods did not accomplish the wish, the
man was of course free, and sometimes the contract would be carried so
far that a time-limit for their action would be fixed by the maker of
the vow: legal exactness can hardly go further.</p>

<p>Or again, the initiative might come from the gods. Some marked
misfortune, an earthquake, lightning, a great famine, a portentous
birth, or some such occurrence would be recognised as a <i>prodigium</i>,
or sign of the god's displeasure. Somehow or other the contract must
have been <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>broken on the human side and it was the duty of the state
to see to the restoration of the <i>pax deum</i>, the equilibrium of the
normal relation of god and man. The right proceeding in such a case
was a <i>lustratio</i>, a solemn cleansing of the people&mdash;or the portion of
the people involved in the god's displeasure&mdash;with the double object
of removing the original reason of misfortune and averting future
causes of the divine anger. The commercial notion is not perhaps quite
so distinct here, but the underlying legal relationship is
sufficiently marked.</p>

<p>If then the question be asked whether the relation between the Roman
and his gods was friendly or unfriendly, the correct answer would
probably be that it was neither. It was rather what Aristotle in
speaking of human relations describes as 'a friendship for profit': it
is entered into because both sides hope for some advantage&mdash;it is
maintained as long as both sides fulfil their obligations.</p>

<p><b>3. Ceremonial.</b>&mdash;It has been said sometimes that the old Roman
religion was one of cult and ritual without dogma or belief. As we
have seen this is not in origin strictly true, and it would be fairer
to say that belief was latent rather than non-existent: this we may
see, for instance, from <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>Cicero's dialogues on the subject of
religion, where in discussion the fundamental sense of the dependence
of man on the help of the gods comes clearly into view: in the
domestic worship of the family too cult was always to some extent
'tinged with emotion,' and sanctified by a belief which made it a more
living and in the end a more permanent reality than the religion of
the state. But it is no doubt true that as the community advanced,
belief tended to sink into the background: development took place in
cult and not in theology, so that by the end of the Republic, to take
an example, though the festival of the Furrinalia was duly observed
every year on the 25th of July, the nature or function of the goddess
Furrina was, as we learn from Cicero, a pure matter of conjecture, and
Varro tells us that her name was known only to a few persons. Nor was
it mere lapse of time which tended to obscure theology and exalt
ceremonial: their relative position was the immediate and natural
outcome of the underlying idea of the relation of god and man.
Devotion, piety&mdash;in our sense of the term&mdash;and a feeling of the divine
presence could not be enjoined or even encouraged by the strictly
legal conception on which religion was based: the 'contract-notion'
required not a 'right spirit' but <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>right performance. And so it comes
about that in all the records we have left of the old religion the
salient feature which catches and retains our attention is exactness
of ritual. All must be performed not merely 'decently and in order,'
but with the most scrupulous care alike for every detail of the
ceremonial itself, and for the surrounding circumstances. The omission
or misplacement of a single word in the formul&aelig;, the slightest sign of
resistance on the part of the victim, any disorder among the
bystanders, even the accidental squeak of a mouse, are sufficient to
vitiate the whole ritual and necessitate its repetition from the very
beginning. One of the main functions of the Roman priesthood was to
preserve intact the tradition of formul&aelig; and ritual, and, when the
magistrate offered sacrifice for the state, the <i>pontifex</i> stood at
his side and dictated (<i>praeire</i>) the formul&aelig; which he must use.
Almost the oldest specimen of Latin which we now possess is the song
of the Salii, the priests of Mars, handed on from generation to
generation and repeated with scrupulous care, even though the priests
themselves, as Quintilian assures us, had not the least notion what it
meant. Nor was it merely the words of ceremonial which were of vital
importance: other details must be attended <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>to with equal exactness.
Place, as we have seen, was an essential feature even in the
conception of deity, and it must have required all the personal
influence of Augustus and his entourage to reconcile the people of
Rome, with the ancient home of the goddess still before their eyes, to
the second shrine of Vesta within the limits of his palace on the
Palatine. The choice of the appropriate offering again was a matter of
the greatest moment and was dictated by a large number of
considerations. The sex of the victim must correspond to the sex of
the deity to whom it is offered, white beasts must be given to the
gods of the upper world, black victims to the deities below. Mars at
his October festival must have his horse, Iuno Caprotina her goat, and
Robigus his dog, while in the more rustic festivals such as the
Parilia, the offering would be the simpler gift of millet-cakes and
bowls of milk: in the case of the Bona Dea we have the curious
provision that if wine were used in the ceremonial, it must, as she
was in origin a pastoral deity, always be spoken of as 'milk.' The
persons who might be present in the various festivals were also
rigidly determined: men were excluded from the Matronalia on March 1,
from the Vestalia on the 9th of June, and from the night festival of
the Bona Dea: the <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>notorious escapade of Clodius in 62 <span class="fakesc">B.C.</span>
shows the scandal raised by a breach of this rule even at the period
when religious enthusiasm was at its lowest ebb. Slaves were
specifically admitted to a share in certain festivals such as the
Saturnalia and the Compitalia (the festival of the Lares), whereas at
the Matralia (the festival of the matrons) a female slave was brought
in with the express purpose of being significantly driven away.</p>

<p>The general notion of the exactness of ritual will perhaps become
clearer when we come to examine some of the festivals in detail, but
it is of extreme importance for the understanding of the Roman
religious attitude, to think of it from the first as an essential part
in the expression of the relation of man to god.</p>

<p><b>4. Directness of Relation&mdash;Functions of Priests.</b>&mdash;In contrast to all
this precision of ritual, which tends almost to alienate humanity from
deity, we may turn to another hardly less prominent feature of the
Roman religion&mdash;the immediateness of relation between the god and his
worshippers. Not only may the individual at any time approach the
altar of the god with his prayer or thank-offering, but in every
community of persons its religious representative is its natural head.
In <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>the family the head of the household (<i>pater familias</i>) is also
the priest and he is responsible for conducting the religious worship
of the whole house, free and slave alike: to his wife and daughters he
leaves the ceremonial connected with the hearth (<i>Vesta</i>) and the
deities of the store-cupboard (<i>Penates</i>), and to his bailiff the
sacrifice to the powers who protect his fields (<i>Lares</i>), but the
other acts of worship at home and in the fields he conducts himself,
and his sons act as his acolytes. Once a year he meets with his
neighbours at the boundaries of their properties and celebrates the
common worship over the boundary-stones. So in<a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> the larger outgrowth
of the family, the <i>gens</i>, which consisted of all persons with the
same surname (<i>nomen</i>, not <i>cognomen</i>), the gentile <i>sacra</i> are in the
hands of the more wealthy members who are regarded as its heads; we
have the curious instance of Clodius even after his adoption into
another family, providing for the worship of the <i>gens Clodia</i> in his
own house, and we may remember Virgil's picture of the founders of the
<i>gentes</i> of the Potitii and the Pinarii performing the sacrifice to
Hercules at the <i>ara maxima</i>, which was the traditional privilege of
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>their houses. When societies (<i>sodalitates</i>) are formed for religious
purposes they elect their own <i>magistri</i> to be their religious
representatives, as we see in the case of the Salii and the Luperci.
Finally, in the great community of the state the king is priest, and
with that exactness of parallelism of which the Roman was so fond,
he&mdash;like the <i>pater familias</i>&mdash;leaves the worship of Vesta in the
hands of his 'daughters,' the Vestal virgins. And so, when the
Republic is instituted, a special official, the <i>rex sacrorum</i>,
inherits the king's ritual duties, while the superintendence of the
Vestals passes to his representative in the matter of religious law,
the <i>pontifex maximus</i>, whose official residence is always the
<i>regia</i>, Numa's palace. The state is but the enlarged household and
the head of the state is its religious representative.</p>

<p>If then the approach to the gods is so direct, where, it may be asked,
in the organisation of Roman religion is there room for the priest?
Two points about the Roman priesthood are of paramount importance. In
the first place, they are not a caste apart: though there were
restrictions as to the holding of secular magistracies in combination
with the priesthood&mdash;always observed strictly in the case of the <i>rex
sacrorum</i> and with few exceptions in the case of the greater
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span><i>flamines</i>&mdash;yet the <i>pontifices</i> might always take their part in
public life, and no kind of barrier existed between them and the rest
of the community: Iulius C&aelig;sar himself was <i>pontifex maximus</i>. In the
second place they are not regarded as representatives of the gods or
as mediators between god and man, but simply as administrative
officials appointed for the performance of the acts of state-worship,
just as the magistrates were for its civil and military government. In
origin they were chosen to assist the king in the multifarious duties
of the state-cult&mdash;the <i>flamines</i> were to act as special priests of
particular deities, the most prominent among them being the three
great priests of Iuppiter (<i>flamen Dialis</i>), Mars, and Quirinus; the
<i>pontifices</i> were sometimes delegates of the king on special
occasions, but more particularly formed his religious <i>consilium</i>, a
consulting body, to give him advice as to ritual and act as the
repositories of tradition. In later times the <i>flamines</i> still retain
their original character, the <i>pontifices</i> and especially the
<i>pontifex maximus</i> are responsible for the whole organisation of the
state-religion and are the guardians and interpreters of religious
lore. In the state-cult then the priests play a very important part,
but their relation to the worship of the individual was very small
indeed. They had <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>a general superintendence over private worship and
their leave would be required for the introduction of any new domestic
cult; in cases too where the private person was in doubt as to ritual
or the legitimacy of any religious practice, he could appeal to the
<i>pontifices</i> for decision. Otherwise the priest could never intervene
in the worship of the family, except in the case of the most solemn
form of marriage (<i>confarreatio</i>), which, as it conferred on the
children the right to hold certain of the priesthoods, was regarded
itself as a ceremony of the state-religion.</p>

<p>In his private worship then the individual had immediate access to the
deity, and it was no doubt this absence of priestly mediation and the
consequent sense of personal responsibility, no less than its
emotional significance, which caused the greater reality and
permanence of the domestic worship as compared with the organised and
official cults of the state.</p>

<h4>EARLY HISTORY OF ROME&mdash;THE AGRICULTURAL COMMUNITY</h4>
<br />

<p>After this sketch of the main features which we must expect to find in
Roman religion, we may attempt to look a little more in detail at its
various departments, but before doing so it is necessary to form some
notion of the situation and character of the Roman community: religion
is not a little determined by men's natural surroundings and
occupations. The subject is naturally one of considerable controversy,
but certain facts of great significance for our purpose may fairly be
taken as established. The earliest settlement which can be called
'Rome' was the community of the Palatine hill, which rises out of the
valleys more abruptly than any of the other hills and was the natural
place to be selected for fortification: the outline of the walls and
sacred enclosure running outside them (<i>pomoerium</i>) may still be
traced, marking the limits <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>of 'square Rome' (<i>Roma quadrata</i>), as the
historians called it. The Palatine community no doubt pursued their
agricultural labours over the neighbouring valleys and hills, and
gradually began to extend their settlement till it included the
Esquiline and Caelian and other lesser heights which made up the
Septimontium&mdash;the next stage of Rome's development. Meanwhile a
kindred settlement had been established on the opposite hills of the
Quirinal and Viminal, and ultimately the two communities united,
enclosing within their boundaries the Capitol and their meeting-place
in the valley which separated them&mdash;the Forum. In this way was formed
the Rome of the Four Regions, which represents the utmost extent of
its development during the period which gave rise to the genuine Roman
religion. All these stages have left their mark on the customs of
religion. <i>Roma quadrata</i> comes to the fore in the Lupercalia: not
merely is the site of the ceremony a grotto on the Palatine
(<i>Lupercal</i>), but when the <i>Luperci</i> run their purificatory course
around the boundaries, it is the circuit of the Palatine hill which
marks its limits. Annually on the 11th of December the festival of the
Septimontium was celebrated, not by the whole people, but by the
<i>montani</i>, presumably the inhabitants of those <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>parts of Rome which
were included in the second settlement. Finally, the addition of the
Quirinal settlement is marked by the inclusion among the great
state-gods of Quirinus, who must have been previously the local deity
of the Quirinal community.</p>

<p>But more important for us than the history of the early settlement is
its character. We have spoken of early Rome as an agricultural
community: it would be more exact and more helpful to describe it as a
community of agricultural households. The institutions of Rome, legal
as well as religious, all point to the household (<i>familia</i>) as the
original unit of organisation: the individual, as such, counted for
nothing, the community was but the aggregate of families. Domestic
worship then was not merely independent of the religion of the
community: it was prior to it, and is both its historical and logical
origin. Yet the life of the early Roman agriculturalist could not be
confined to the household: in the tilling of the fields and the care
of his cattle he meets his neighbour, and common interests suggest
common prayer and thanksgiving. Thus there sprung up the great series
of agricultural festivals which form the basis of the state-calendar,
but were in origin&mdash;as some of them <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>still continued to be&mdash;the
independent acts of worship of groups of agricultural households.
Gradually, as the community grew on the lines we have just seen, there
grew with it a sense of an organised state, as something more than the
casual aggregation of households or clans (<i>gentes</i>). As the feeling
of union became stronger, so did the necessity for common worship of
the gods, and the state-cult came into being primarily as the
repetition on behalf of the community as a whole of the worship which
its members performed separately in their households or as
joint-worshippers in the fields. But the conception of a state must
carry with it at least two ideas over and beyond the common needs of
its members: there must be internal organisation to secure domestic
tranquillity, and&mdash;since there will be collision with other
states&mdash;external organisation for purposes of offence and defence.
Religion follows the new ideas, and in two of the older deities of the
fields develops the notions of justice and war. Organisation ensues,
and the general conceptions of state-deities and state-ritual are made
more definite and precise.</p>

<p>It will be at once natural and convenient that we should consider
these three departments of religion in the order that has just been
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>suggested&mdash;the worship of the household, the worship of the fields,
the worship of the state. But it must not be forgotten that both the
departments themselves and the evidence for them frequently overlap.
The domestic worship is not wholly distinguishable from that of the
fields, the state-cult is, as we have seen, very largely a replica of
the other two. The evidence for the domestic and agricultural cults is
in itself very scanty, and we shall frequently have to draw inferences
from their counterparts in the state. Above all, it is not to be
supposed that any hard and fast line between the three existed in the
Roman's mind; but for the purposes of analysis the distinction is
valuable and represents a historical reality.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER V<span class="totoc"><a href="#toc">ToC</a></span></h3>

<h4>WORSHIP OF THE HOUSEHOLD</h4>
<br />

<p><b>1. The Deities.</b>&mdash;The worship of the household seems to have
originated, as has been suggested, in the sense of the sacredness of
certain objects closely bound up with the family life&mdash;the door, the
protection against the external world, by which the household went out
to work in the morning and returned at evening, the hearth, the giver
of warmth and nourishment, and the store-cupboard, where was preserved
the food for future use. At first, in all probability, the worship was
actually of the objects themselves, but by the time that Rome can be
said to have existed at all, 'animism' had undoubtedly transformed it
into a veneration of the indwelling spirits, Ianus, Vesta, and the
Penates.</p>

<p>Of the domestic worship of Ianus no information has come down to us,
but we may well suppose that as the defence of the door and its main
use lay with the men of the household, so they, under <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>the control of
the <i>pater familias</i>, were responsible for the cult of its spirit.
Vesta was, of course, worshipped at the hearth by the women, who most
often used it in the preparation of the domestic meals. In the
original round hut, such as the primitive Roman dwelt in&mdash;witness the
models which he buried with his dead and which recent excavations in
the Forum have brought to light&mdash;the 'blazing hearth' (such seems to
be the meaning of Vesta) would be the most conspicuously sacred thing;
it is therefore not surprising to find that her simple cult was the
most persistent of all throughout the history of Rome, and did not
vary from its original notion. Even Ovid can tell the inquirer 'think
not Vesta to be ought else than living flame,' and again, 'Vesta and
fire require no effigy'&mdash;notions in which he has come curiously near
to the conceptions of the earliest religion. The Penates in the same
way were at first 'the spirits'&mdash;whoever they might be&mdash;who preserved
and increased the store in the cupboard. Then as the conception of
individual deities became clearer, they were identified with some one
or other of the gods of the country or the state, among whom the
individual householder would select those who should be the particular
Penates of his family: Ceres, Iuno, <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>Iuppiter, Pales would be some of
those chosen in the earlier period. Nor are we to suppose that
selection was merely arbitrary: the tradition of family and clan, even
possibly of locality, would determine the choice, much as the
patron-saints of a church are now determined in a Roman Catholic
country.</p>

<p>Two other deities are very prominent in the worship of the early
household, and each is a characteristic product of Roman religious
feeling, the Lar Familiaris and the Genius. The Lares<a name="FNanchor_5_5" id="FNanchor_5_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> seem to have
been in origin the spirits of the family fields: they were worshipped,
as Cicero tells us, 'on the farm in sight of the house,' and they had
their annual festival in the Compitalia, celebrated at the
<i>compita</i>&mdash;places where two or more properties marched. But one of
these spirits, the <i>Lar Familiaris</i>, had special charge of the house
and household, and as such was worshipped with the other domestic gods
at the hearth. As his protection extended over all the household,
including the slaves, his cult is placed specially in the charge of
the bailiff's wife (<i>vilica</i>). He is <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>regularly worshipped at the
great divisions of the month on Calends, Nones, and Ides, but he has
also an intimate and beautiful connection with the domestic history of
the family. An offering is made to the Lar on the occasion of a birth,
a wedding, a departure, or a return, and even&mdash;a characteristically
Roman addition&mdash;on the occasion of the first utterance of a word by a
son of the house: finally, a particularly solemn sacrifice is made to
him after a death in the family.</p>

<p>The Genius is perhaps the most difficult conception in the Roman
religion for the modern mind to grasp. It has been spoken of as the
'patron-saint' or 'guardian-angel,' both of them conceptions akin to
that of the Genius, but both far too definite and anthropomorphic: we
shall understand it best by keeping the '<i>numen</i>' notion clearly in
mind and looking to the root-meaning of the word (<i>genius</i> connected
with the root of <i>gignere</i>, to beget). It was after all only a natural
development of the notions of 'animism' to imagine that man too, like
other objects, had his indwelling spirit&mdash;not his 'soul' either in our
sense of moral and intellectual powers, or in the ancient sense of the
vital principle&mdash;but rather as the derivation suggests, in origin
simply the spirit which gave him the power of generation. <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>Hence in
the house, the sphere of the Genius is no longer the hearth but the
marriage-bed (<i>lectus genialis</i>). This notion growing somewhat wider,
the Genius comes to denote all the full powers, almost the
personality, of developed manhood, and especially those powers which
make for pleasure and happiness: this is the origin of such common
phrases as <i>genium curare</i>, <i>genio indulgere</i>, meaning practically to
'look after oneself,' 'to indulge oneself.' Every man, then, has this
'spirit of his manhood' in his Genius, and correspondingly every woman
her Iuno, or spirit of womanhood, which are worshipped on the
birthdays of their owners. No doubt later the Genius was accredited
with powers over the fortune and misfortune of his possessor, but he
never really developed anything like the independence of a god, and
remained always rather a <i>numen</i>. The individual revered his own
Genius, but the household cult was concerned, as one would expect,
with the Genius of the master of the house, the pre-eminent Genius of
the family. Its special locality was, for the reason just noticed, the
marriage-bed and its symbol, the house-snake, kept as a revered inmate
and cherished in the feeling that evil happening to it meant
misfortune to the master. The festival of the Genius was <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>naturally
the master's birthday, and on that day slaves and freedmen kept
holiday with the family and brought offerings to the <i>Genius domus</i>.
It is a significant fact, and may serve to bring out the underlying
notion, that in later paintings, when anthropomorphism and sensuous
representation held sway over all Roman religion, though the other
gods of the household were depicted after the manner of Greek deities,
the Genius is either represented by his symbolic snake or appears with
the human features and characteristics of the head of the house, his
owner.</p>

<p>The spirit-gods then of the door and the hearth, the specially chosen
deities of the store-cupboard, the particular field-power presiding
over the household, and the spirit of the master's personality were
the gods of the early home, and round their worship centred the
domestic religion. We must attempt to see what was its relation to
family life.</p>

<p><b>2. Religion and the Family Life.</b>&mdash;We have already noticed the main
occasions of regular sacrifice to the deities of the household, the
offerings to the Lar on Calends, Nones, and Ides, to the Genius on the
master's birthday, and so on, and we are enabled to form a fair
picture of the rites from <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>paintings which, although of later date,
undoubtedly represent the continuous tradition of domestic custom. In
a wall-painting at Herculaneum, for instance, we have a picture of the
<i>pater familias</i>, represented with veiled head (according to regular
Roman custom) and the cornucopia of the Genius, making sacrifice at a
round altar or hearth. Opposite him stands the flute-player
(<i>tibicen</i>) playing to drown any unpropitious sound, while on either
side are two smaller figures, presumably the sons, acting as
attendants (<i>camilli</i>), and both clad (<i>succincti</i>) in the short
sacrificial tunic (<i>limus</i>); one carries in his left hand the sacred
dish (<i>patera</i>), and in his right garlands or, more probably, ribbons
for the decoration of the victim: the other is acting as <i>victimarius</i>
and bringing the pig for sacrifice, but the animal is hurrying with
almost excessive eagerness towards the altar, no doubt to show that
there is none of the reluctance which would have been sufficient to
vitiate the sacrifice.</p>

<p>But from our point of view such formal acts of worship are of less
importance than the part played by religion in the daily life of the
household. There is evidence both for earlier and later periods that
the really 'pious' would begin their day with prayer and sacrifice to
the <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>household gods, and like Virgil's Aeneas, typically <i>pius</i> in all
the meanings of the word, would 'rouse the slumbering flame upon the
altar and gladly approach again the Lar and little Penates whom he
worshipped yesterday.' But this was perhaps exceptional devotion, and
the daily worship in the normal household centred rather round the
family meal. In the old and simple house the table would be placed at
the side of the hearth, and, as the household sat round it, master and
man together, a part of the meal, set aside on a special sacred dish
(<i>patella</i>), would be thrown into the flames as the gods' portion.
Sometimes incense might be added, and later a libation of wine: when
images had become common, the little statuettes of Lares and Penates
would be fetched from the shrine (<i>lararium</i>) and placed upon the
table in token of their presence at the meal. Even in the luxurious,
many-roomed house of the imperial epoch, when the dining-table was far
from the kitchen-hearth, a pause was made in the meal and an offering
sent out to the household-gods, nor would the banquet proceed until
the slave had returned and announced that the gods were favourable
(<i>deos propitios</i>): so persistent was this tradition of domestic
piety. Prayer might be made at this point on special <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>occasions to
special deities, as, for instance, before the beginning of the sowing
of the crops, appeal was made to Iuppiter, and a special portion of
the meal (<i>daps</i>) was set aside for him. The sanctification of the one
occasion when the whole household met in the day cannot fail to have
had its effect on the domestic life, and, even if it was no direct
incentive to morality, it yet bound the family together in a sense of
dependence on a higher power for the supply of their daily needs.</p>

<p>We observed incidentally how the small events of domestic life were
given their religious significance, particularly in connection with
the worship of Lar and Genius, but to complete the sketch of domestic
religion, we must examine a little more closely its relation to the
process of life, and especially to the two important occasions of
birth and marriage. In no department of life is the specialisation of
function among the <i>numina</i> more conspicuous than in connection with
birth and childhood. Apart from the general protection of Iuno Lucina,
the prominent divinity of childbirth, we can count in the records that
have come down to us some twenty subordinate spirits, who from the
moment of conception to the moment of birth watched, each in its own
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>particular sphere, over the mother and the unborn child. As soon as
the birth had taken place began a series of ceremonies, which are of
particular interest, as they seem to belong to a very early stage of
religious thought, and have a markedly rustic character. Immediately a
sacred meal was offered to the two field-deities, Picumnus and
Pilumnus, and then the Roman turned his attention to the practical
danger of fever for the mother and child. At night three men gathered
round the threshold, one armed with an axe, another with a stake, and
a third with a broom: the two first struck the threshold with their
implements, the third swept out the floor. Over this ceremony were
said to preside three <i>numina</i>, Intercidona (connected with the axe),
Pilumnus (connected with the stake, <i>pilum</i>), and Deverra (connected
with the act of sweeping). Its object was, as Varro explains it, to
avert the entrance of the half-wild Silvanus by giving three
unmistakeable signs of human civilisation; we shall probably not be
wrong in seeing in it rather an actual hacking, beating, and sweeping
away of evil spirits. On the ninth day after birth, in the case of a
boy, on the eighth in the case of a girl, occurred the festival of the
naming (<i>solemnitas nominalium</i>). The ceremony was <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>one of
purification (<i>dies lustricus</i> is its alternative title), and a
piacular offering was made to preserve the child from evil influences
in the future. Friends brought presents, especially neck-bands in the
form of a half-moon (<i>lunulae</i>), and the golden balls (<i>bullae</i>) which
were worn as a charm round the neck until the attainment of manhood.</p>

<p>Of the numerous petty divinities which watched over the child's early
years we have already given some account. In their protection he
remained until he arrived at puberty, about the age of seventeen, when
with due religious ceremony he entered on his manhood. At home, on the
morning of the festival, he solemnly laid aside the <i>bulla</i> and the
purple-striped garb of childhood (<i>toga praetexta</i>) before the shrine
of the household gods, and made them a thank-offering for their
protection in the past. Afterwards, accompanied by his father and
friends and clad now in the <i>toga virilis</i>, he went solemnly to the
Capitol, and, after placing a contribution in the coffers of
Iuventas&mdash;or probably in earlier times of Iuppiter Iuventus&mdash;made an
offering to the supreme deity Iuppiter Capitolinus. The sacred
character of the early years of a young Roman's life could hardly be
more closely marked.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>Though <i>confarreatio</i> was the only essentially religious form of
marriage, and was sanctified by the presence of the <i>pontifex maximus</i>
and the <i>flamen Dialis</i>, yet marriage even in the less religious
ceremony of <i>coemptio</i> was always a <i>sacrum</i>. It must not take place
on the days of state-festivals (<i>feriae</i>), nor on certain other <i>dies
religiosi</i>, such as those of the Vestalia or the feast of the dead
(<i>Parentalia</i>). Both the marriage itself and the preliminary betrothal
(<i>sponsalia</i>) had to receive the divine sanction by means of auspices,
and in the ceremonies of both rites the religious element, though
bound up with superstition and folk-customs, emerges clearly enough.
The central ceremony of the <i>confarreatio</i> was an act partly of
sacrifice, partly, one might almost say, of communion. The bride and
bridegroom sat on two chairs united to one another and covered with a
lambskin, they offered to Iuppiter bloodless offerings of a rustic
character (<i>fruges et molam salsam</i>), they employed in the sacrifice
the fundamental household necessaries, water, fire, and salt, and
themselves ate of the sacred spelt-cake (<i>libus farreus</i>), from which
the ceremony derived its name. The crucial point in the more civil
ceremony of <i>coemptio</i> was the purely human and legal act of the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>joining of hands (<i>dextrarum iunctio</i>), but it was immediately
followed by the sacrifice of a victim, which gave the ceremony a
markedly religious significance. The customs connected with the
bringing of the bride to the bridegroom's house&mdash;so beautifully
depicted in Catullus' <i>Epithalamium</i>&mdash;her forcible abduction from her
parents, the ribaldry of the bridegroom's companions, the throwing of
nuts as a symbol of fecundity, the carrying of the bride over the
threshold, a relic probably of primitive marriage by capture, the
untying of the bridal knot on the bridal couch&mdash;are perhaps more akin
to superstition than religion, but we may notice two points in the
proceedings. Firstly, the three coins (<i>asses</i>) which the bride
brought with her, one to give to her husband as a token of dowry, one
to be offered at the hearth to her new Lar Familiaris, one to be
offered subsequently at the nearest <i>compitum</i> (a clear sign of
connection between the household Lar and those of the fields); and
secondly, an echo of the feature so marked all through domestic life,
the crowd of little <i>numina</i>, who took their part in assisting the
ceremony. There was Domiduca, who brought the bride to the
bridegroom's house, Iterduca, who looked after her on the transit,
Unxia, who <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>anointed her, Cinxia, who bound and unbound her girdle,
and many others.</p>

<p>This sketch of the household worship of the Romans will, I hope, have
justified my contention that there was in it an element more truly
'religious' than anything we should gather from the ceremonies of the
state. The ideas are simpler, the <i>numina</i> seem less cold and more
protective, the worshippers more sensible of divine aid. When we have
looked at the companion picture of the farmer in the fields, we shall
go on to see how the worship of the agricultural household is the
prototype and basis of the state-cult, but first we must consider
briefly the very difficult question of the relation of the living to
the dead.</p>

<p><b>3. Relation of the Living and the Dead.</b>&mdash;The worship of the spirits
of dead ancestors is so common a feature in most primitive religions
that it may seem strange even to doubt whether it existed among the
Romans, but, although the question is one of extreme difficulty, and
the evidence very insufficient, I am inclined to believe that, though
the living were always conscious of their continued relation to the
dead, and sensitive of the influence of the powers of the underworld,
yet there was not, strictly speaking, any cult of the dead. Let us
attempt briefly to collect the <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>salient features in ritual, and see to
what conclusion they point as to the underlying belief.</p>

<p>One of the most remarkable facts in domestic worship is that, whereas
the moment of birth and the other great occasions of life are
surrounded with religious ceremony and belief, the moment of death
passes without any trace of religious accompaniment: it is as though
the dying man went out into another world where the ceremonials of
this life can no more avail him, nor its gods protect him. As to his
state after death, opinion varied at different times under different
influences, but the simple early notion, connected especially with the
practice of burial as opposed to cremation,<a name="FNanchor_6_6" id="FNanchor_6_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> was that his spirit
just sank into the earth, where it rested and returned from time to
time to the upper world through certain openings in the ground
(<i>mundi</i>), whose solemn uncovering was one of the regular observances
of the festal calendar: later, no doubt, a more spiritual notion
prevailed, though it never reached definiteness or universality. One
idea, however, seems always to be prominent, that the happiness of the
dead could be much affected by the due performance <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>of the funeral
rites; hence it was the most solemn duty of the heir to perform the
<i>iusta</i> for the dead, and if he failed in any respect to carry them
out, he could only atone for his omission by the annual sacrifice of a
sow (<i>porca praecidanea</i>) to Ceres and Tellus&mdash;to the divinities of
the earth, be it noticed, and not to the dead themselves. The actual
funeral was not a religious ceremony; a procession was formed
(originally at night) of the family and friends, in which the body of
the dead was carried&mdash;accompanied by the busts (<i>imagines</i>) of his
ancestors&mdash;to a tomb outside the town, and was there laid in the
grave. The family on their return proceeded at once to rites of
purification from the contamination which had overtaken them owing to
the presence of a dead body. Two ceremonies were performed, one for
the purification of the house by the sacrifice of a sow (<i>porca
praesentanea</i>) to Ceres accompanied by a solemn sweeping out of refuse
(<i>exverr&aelig;</i>), the other the lustration of their own persons by fire and
water. This done, they sat down with their friends to a funeral feast
(<i>silicernium</i>), which, Cicero tells us, was regarded as an honour
rather to the surviving members of the family than to the dead, so
that mourning was not worn. Two other ceremonies within the following
week, the <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span><i>feriae denicales</i> and the <i>novendiale sacrum</i>, brought the
religious mourning to a close. Not that the dead were forgotten after
the funeral: year by year, on the anniversaries of death and burial,
and on certain fixed occasions known by such suggestive titles as 'the
day of roses' and 'the day of violets,' the family would revisit the
tomb and make simple offerings of salt cake (<i>mola salsa</i>), of bread
soaked in wine, or garlands of flowers: there is some trace, on such
occasions, of prayer, but it would seem to be rather the repetition of
general religious formul&aelig; than a petition to the dead for definite
blessings.</p>

<p>Such are the principal features of the family ritual in relation to
their dead; but if we are to form any just notion of belief, we must
supplement them by reference to the ceremonies of the state, which
here, as elsewhere, are very clearly the household-cult 'writ large.'
In the Calendars we find two obvious celebrations in connection with
the dead, taking place at different seasons of the year, and
consisting of ceremonies markedly different in character. In the
gloomy month of February&mdash;associated with solemn lustrations&mdash;occurs
the festival known popularly (though not in the Calendars) as the
Parentalia or dies Parentales, that is, the days of sacrifice in
connection <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>with the dead members of the family (<i>parentes</i>,
<i>parentare</i>). It begins with the note on February 13, <i>Virgo Vestalis
parentat</i>, and continues till the climax, <i>Feralia</i>, on February 21.
During these days the magistrates laid aside the insignia of their
offices, the temples were shut, marriages were forbidden, and every
family carried out at the tombs of its relatives ceremonies resembling
those of the <i>sacra privata</i>. The whole season closed on February 22
with the festival of the Caristia or <i>cara cognatio</i>, a family reunion
of the survivors in a kind of 'love-feast,' which centred in the
worship of the Lar Familiaris. Here we seem to have simply, as in the
family rites, a peaceful and solemn acknowledgment by the community as
a whole of the still subsisting relation of the living and the dead.
On the 9th, 11th, and 13th of May occurs the Lemuria, a ceremony of a
strikingly different order. Once again temples are shut and marriages
forbidden, but the ritual is of a very different nature. The <i>Lemures</i>
or <i>Larvae</i>&mdash;for there seems to be little distinction between the two
names&mdash;are regarded no longer as members of the family to be welcomed
back to their place, but as hostile spirits to be exorcised.<a name="FNanchor_7_7" id="FNanchor_7_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>The
head of the house rises from bed at midnight, washes, and walks
barefoot through the house, making signs for the aversion of evil
spirits. In his mouth he carries black beans&mdash;always a chthonic
symbol&mdash;which he spits out nine times without looking round, saying,
as he does so, 'With these I redeem me and mine': he washes again, and
clanks brass vessels together; nine times he repeats the formula,
'depart, Manes of our fathers' (no doubt using the dignified title
Manes euphemistically), and then finally turns round. Here we have in
a quite unmistakeable manner the feeling of the hostility of the
spirits of the dead: they must be given their appropriate food and got
out of the place as quickly as possible. Some scholars have attempted
to explain the difference between these two festivals on the
assumption that the Parentalia represents the commemoration of the
duly buried dead, the Lemuria the apotropaic right for the aversion of
the unburied, and therefore hostile spirits; but Ovid has given a far
more significant hint, when he tells us that the Lemuria was the more
ancient festival of the two.</p>

<p>So far we have had no indication of anything approaching divinity in
connection with the dead or the underworld as distinct from the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>earth-goddesses, but the evidence for it, though vague and shadowy, is
not wanting. Certain mysterious female deities, Tarpeia, Acca
Larentia, Carna, and Laverna, of whom late &aelig;tiological myth had its
own explanation, have, in all probability, been rightly interpreted by
Mommsen as divinities of the lower world: the commemorative 'sacrifice
at the tomb,' which we hear of in connection with the first two, was
in reality, we may suppose, an offering to a chthonic deity at a
<i>mundus</i>. A rather more tangible personality is Vediovis, who three
times a year has his celebration (<i>Agonia</i> not <i>feriae</i>) in the
Calendar: he, as his name denotes, must be the 'opposite of Iove,'
that is, probably, his chthonic counterpart, a notion sufficiently
borne out by his subsequent identification with the Greek Pluto.
Finally, of course, there is that vague body, the Di Manes, 'the good
gods,' the principal deities of the world of the dead; to them
invocations are addressed, and they have their place in the formul&aelig; of
the <i>parentalia</i> and the opening of the <i>mundi</i>.<a name="FNanchor_8_8" id="FNanchor_8_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a> In connection with
them, acting as a link with the female deities, we have the strange
goddess Genita Mana, the 'spirit of birth and death.'</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>Controversy is acute as to the interpretation of these facts,
especially in regard to the question whether or no the spirits of the
dead were actually worshipped. I would hazard the following
reconstruction of history as consistent with what we otherwise know of
Roman religion, and with the evidence before us. From the earliest
times the Roman looked upon his dead relations as in some sense
living, lying beneath the earth, but capable alike of returning to the
world above and of influencing in some vague way the fortunes of the
living, especially in relation to the crops which sprung from the
ground in which they lay. At first, when his religion was one of fear,
he regarded the dead as normally hostile, and their presence as
something to be averted; this is the stage which gave birth to the
Lemuria. As civilisation increased, and the sense of the unity of
household and community developed, fear, proving ungrounded, gave
place to a kindlier feeling of the continued existence of the dead as
members of household and state, and even in some sense as an
additional bond between the living: this is the period which produced
the <i>sacra privata</i> and the Parentalia. When the <i>numen</i>-feeling began
to pass into that of <i>deus</i>, in the first place a connection was felt
between the spirits of the dead and the <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>deities of the earth
associated with the growth of the crops, in the second the notion that
the underworld must have its gods as well as the world above, produced
the shadowy female deities and Vediovis. Lastly, the same kind of
feeling which added Parentalia to Lemuria developed the vague general
notion of the Di Manes, not the deified spirits of the dead, but
peaceful and on the whole kindly divinities holding sway in the world
of dead spirits, yet accessible to the prayers of the living. The
dead, then, were not themselves worshipped, but they needed
commemoration and kindly gifts, and they had in their lower world
deities to whom prayer might be made and worship given.</p>

<h4>WORSHIP OF THE FIELDS</h4>
<br />

<p>The life of the early Roman in the fields, his activities, his hopes
and fears, are reflected in the long list of agricultural festivals
which constitute the greater part of the celebrations in the Calendar,
and follow closely the seasons and occupations of the agricultural
year. We are, of course, in the Calendar dealing, to speak strictly,
with the worship of the state, and not with the semi-private festivals
of groups of farmers, but in many instances, such as the Robigalia,
the state seems only to have taken over the cult of the farmers,
preserving carefully the site on which the celebration took place; in
others, such as the Terminalia and the Parilia, it seems to have
established, as it were, a state-counterpart of a rite performed
independently at many rustic centres: in both cases we are justified
in inferring the practice of the early Roman agriculturalist. We shall
see that in most cases these festivals are associated&mdash;though <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>often
loosely enough&mdash;with the worship of a particular divinity. Sometimes,
however,&mdash;as in the case of the Lupercalia&mdash;it is very difficult to
discover who this divinity was; in other festivals, such as the
Robigalia, it looks as if the eponymous deity was a comparatively late
development. We may, therefore, suppose, on the analogy of what we
have already seen to be the general lines of development in Roman
religion, that the festivals in origin centred round a purpose rather
than a personality, and were addressed 'to all spirits whom it might
concern'; and that later, when the <i>deus</i> notion was on the increase,
they either attached themselves to some god whose personality was
already distinct, as the Vinalia were attached to Iuppiter, or
'developed' a deity of their own. Among these deities, strictly
functional as a rule and existing only in connection with their
special festival, we shall notice the frequent recurrence of a
divinity pair, not, of course, mythologically related as husband and
wife, but representing, perhaps, the male and female aspects of the
same process of development.</p>

<p>The festivals divide themselves naturally into three groups: those of
Spring, expressive of the hopes and fears for the growing crops and
herds; <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>those of Summer, the festivals of fulfilment, including the
celebration of harvest; and those of Winter, the festivals of sowing,
of social rejoicing, and in the later months of purificatory
anticipation of the coming year.</p>

<p><b>1. Festivals of Spring.</b>&mdash;The old Roman year&mdash;as may be seen clearly
enough from the names of the months still known by numbers, September,
October, etc.&mdash;began in March: according to tradition Romulus reckoned
a year of ten months altogether, and Numa added January and February.
The Spring months properly speaking may be reckoned as March, April,
and May. In March there were in the developed Calendar no festivals of
an immediately recognisable agricultural character, but the whole
month was practically consecrated to its eponymous deity, Mars. Now,
to the Roman of the Republic, Mars was undoubtedly the deity
associated with war, and his special festivals in this month are of a
warlike character: on the 9th the priests (<i>Salii</i>) began the ancient
custom of carrying his sacred shields (<i>ancilia</i>) round the town from
one ordained resting-place to another: on the 19th, Quinquatrus, the
shields were solemnly purified, and on the 23rd the same ceremony was
performed with the war-trumpets: the Equirria <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>(horse-races) of March
14 may have had an agricultural origin&mdash;we shall meet with races later
on as a feature of rustic festivals&mdash;but they were certainly
celebrated in a military manner. Yet there is good reason for
believing that Mars was in origin associated not with war, but with
the growth of vegetation: he was, as we shall see, the chief deity
addressed in the solemn lustration of the fields (<i>Ambarvalia</i>), and
if our general notion of the development of religion with the growing
needs of the agricultural community crystallising into a state be
correct, it may well be that a deity originally concerned with the
interests of the farmer took on himself the protection of the soldier,
when the fully developed state came into collision with its
neighbours. If so, we may well have in these recurring festivals of
Mars the sense, as Mr. Warde Fowler has put it, of 'some great <i>numen</i>
at work, quickening vegetation, and calling into life the powers of
reproduction in man and the animals.' Possibly another agricultural
note is struck in the Liberalia of the 17th: though the cult of Liber
was almost entirely overlaid by his subsequent identification with
Dionysus, it seems right to recognise in him and his female
counterpart, Libera, a general spirit of creativeness.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>The character of April is much more clearly marked: the month is
filled with a series of festivals&mdash;all of a clearly agricultural
nature&mdash;prayers for the crops now in the earth, and the purification
of the men and animals on the farm. The series opens with the
Fordicidia on the 15th, when pregnant cows were sacrificed: their
unborn calves were torn from them and burnt, the ashes being kept by
the Vestal Virgin in Vesta's storehouse (<i>penus Vest&aelig;</i>) for use at the
Parilia. The general symbolism of fertility is very clear; the goddess
associated with the festival is Tellus, the earth herself, and the
local origin of these festivals is shown in the fact that not only was
the sacrifice made for the whole people on the Capitol, but separately
in each one of the <i>curiae</i>. The Fordicidia is closely followed by the
Cerealia on the 19th&mdash;the festival of another earth-goddess (<i>Ceres</i>,
<i>creare</i>)&mdash;more especially connected with the growth of corn. A very
curious feature of the ritual was the fastening of fire-brands to the
tails of foxes, which were then let loose in what was afterwards the
Circus Maximus: a symbol possibly, as Wissowa thinks, of sunlight,
possibly of the vegetation-spirit. But the most important of the April
ceremonies is undoubtedly the Parilia of the 21st, the festival of the
very ancient <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>rustic <i>numen</i>, Pales. Ovid's<a name="FNanchor_9_9" id="FNanchor_9_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a> description of the
celebration is so interesting and so full of the characteristic colour
of the Roman rustic festivals that I may perhaps be pardoned for
reproducing it at greater length. 'Shepherd,' he says, addressing the
rustic worshipper, 'at the first streak of dawn purify thy well-fed
flocks: let water first besprinkle them, and a branch sweep clean the
ground. Let the folds be adorned with leaves and branches fastened to
them, while a trailing wreath covers the gay-decked gates. Let blue
flames rise from the living sulphur and the sheep bleat loud as she
feels the touch of the smoking sulphur. Burn the male olive-branch and
the pine twig and juniper, and let the blazing laurel crackle amid the
hearth. A basket full of millet must go with the millet cakes: this is
the food wherein the country goddess finds pleasure most of all. Give
her too her own share of the feast and her pail of milk, and when her
share has been set aside, then with milk warm from the cow make prayer
to Pales, guardian of the woods.' The poet then recites a long prayer,
in which the farmer first begs forgiveness for any unwitting sins he
may have committed against the rustic deities, such as trespassing on
their groves or sheltering <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>his flocks beneath their altar, and then
prays for the aversion of disease and the prosperity of crops, flocks,
and herds. 'Thus must the goddess be won, this prayer say four times
turning to the sunrise, and wash thy hands in the running stream. Then
set the rustic bowl upon the table in place of the wine-bowl, and
drink the snowy milk and dark must, and soon through the heaps of
crackling straw leap in swift course with eager limbs.' All the
worshippers then set to leaping through the blazing fires, even the
flocks and herds were driven through, and general hilarity reigned.
Many points of detail might be noticed, such as that in the urban
counterpart of the festival, which Ovid carefully distinguishes from
the country celebrations, the fire was sprinkled with the ashes from
the calves of the Fordicidia and the blood of Mars' October
horse&mdash;another link between Mars and agriculture. But it is most
interesting to note the double character of the ceremony&mdash;as a
purification of man and beast on the one hand, and on the other a
prayer for the prosperity of the season to come. Three special
festivals remain in April. At the Vinalia (<i>priora</i>) of the 23rd, the
wine-skins of the previous year were opened and the wine tasted, and,
we may suppose, supplication was <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>made for the vintage to come, the
festival being dedicated to the sky-god, Iuppiter. At the Robigalia of
the 25th the offering of a dog was made for the aversion of mildew
(<i>robigo</i>), to Robigus (who looks like a developed eponymous deity) at
the fifth milestone on the Via Claudia&mdash;the ancient boundary of Roman
territory. The Floralia of the 28th does not occur in the old
Calendars, probably because it was a moveable feast (<i>feriae
conceptivae</i>), but it is an unmistakeable petition to the <i>numen</i>
Flora for the blossoming of the season's flowers.</p>

<p>May was a month of more critical importance for the welfare of the
crops, and therefore its festivals were mostly of a more sombre
character. The 9th, 11th, and 13th were the days set apart for the
Lemuria, the aversion of the hostile spirits of the dead, of which we
have already spoken, and a similarly gloomy character probably
attached to the Agonia of Vediovis on the 21st. But of far the
greatest interest is the moveable feast of the Ambarvalia, the great
lustration of the fields, which took place towards the end of the
month: the date of its occurrence was no doubt fixed according to the
state of the crops in any given year. As the individual farmer
purified his own fields for the aversion of evil, so a solemn
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>lustration of the boundaries of the state was performed by special
priests, known as the Arval brethren (<i>fratres Arvales</i>). With
ceremonial dancing (<i>tripudium</i>) they moved along the boundary-marks
and made the farmer's most complete offering of the pig, sheep, and ox
(<i>suovetaurilia</i>): the fruits of the last year and the new harvest
(<i>aridae et virides</i>) played a large part in the ceremonial, and a
solemn litany was recited for the aversion of every kind of pest from
the crops. In Virgil's account the prayer is made to Ceres, and we
know that in imperial times, when the Ambarvalia became very closely
connected with the worship of the imperial house, the centre of the
cult was the earth-goddess, Dea Dia; but in the earliest account of
the rustic ceremony which we possess in Cato, Mars is addressed in the
unmistakeable character of an agricultural deity. 'Father Mars, I pray
and beseech thee that thou mayest be gracious and favourable to me, to
my home, and my household, for which cause I have ordained that the
offering of pig, sheep, and ox be carried round my fields, my land,
and my farm: that thou mayest avert, ward off, and keep afar all
disease, visible and invisible, all barrenness, waste, misfortune, and
ill weather: that thou mayest suffer our crops, our corn, our vines
and bushes <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>to grow and come to prosperity: that thou mayest preserve
the shepherds and the flocks in safety, and grant health and strength
to me, to my home, and my household.' We have perhaps here another
rustic ceremony addressed in origin to all <i>numina</i>, whom it might
concern, and, as it were, specialising itself from time to time in an
appeal to one definite deity or another, but it is also clear evidence
of an early agricultural association of Mars. The Ambarvalia is one of
the most picturesque of the field ceremonies, and a peculiarly
beautiful and imaginative description of it may be found in the first
chapter of Pater's <i>Marius the Epicurean</i>.</p>

<p>In June and July the farmer was waiting for the completion of the
harvest, and the great state-festivals of the period are not
agricultural.</p>

<p><b>2. Festivals of the Harvest.</b>&mdash;In August the farmer's hopes are at
last realised, and the harvest is brought in. The season is marked by
two closely connected festivals on the 21st and 25th in honour of the
old divinity-pair, Consus (<i>condere</i>), the god of the storehouse and
Ops, the deity of the wealth of harvest. At the Consualia, an offering
is made by the <i>flamen Quirinalis</i>, assisted by the Vestal virgins, at
an underground altar in the Circus Maximus, specially uncovered for
the <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>occasion: here we have probably not so much the notion of a
chthonic deity, as a relic of the simple practices of an early
agricultural age, when the crops were stored underground. The beasts
who had taken part in the harvest were released from their labours
during the day, and were decorated with flowers: the festival included
a race of mules, the regular Italian beasts of burden. Four days after
this general festivity occurred the second harvest-ceremony of the
Opiconsivia, held in the shrine (<i>sacrarium</i>) of the Regia, and
attended only by the <i>pontifex maximus</i> and the Vestal virgins. This
is clearly the state-harvest of the regal period, the symbolic storing
of the state-crops in the sacred storehouse of the palace by the king
and his daughters. Both festivals are significant, and we shall meet
with Consus and Ops again in close connection in December. The
<i>Portunalia</i> of the 17th may have been another harvest-home, if we can
believe the old authorities, who tell us that Portunus was a 'god of
doors' (<i>portae</i>).</p>

<p>The <i>Vinalia Rustica</i> of August 19 we cannot sufficiently interpret
through lack of information: it cannot, of course, have been the
festival of the vintage, for it is too early: it may have been a
propitiatory ceremony for the ripening grapes, in <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>which case it was
probably connected with the <i>auspicatio vindemiae</i>, in which the
<i>flamen Dialis</i> (note again the association of Iuppiter and the vine)
solemnly plucked the first grapes; or it may be a festival of wine,
not vines, in which case its main feature would most likely be the
opening of the last year's vintage.</p>

<p>September contains no great festival, and the harvest-season closes on
October 11 with the <i>Meditrinalia</i>&mdash;the nearest approach to a
thanksgiving for the vintage. On that day the first must of the new
vintage and the wine of the old were solemnly tasted, apparently as a
spell against disease, the worshipper using the strange formula, 'I
drink the new and the old wine, with new wine and old I heal
(<i>medeor</i>) disease.' This ceremony gave its name to the festival and
was the cause of the subsequent evolution of an eponymous deity,
Meditrina, but there is little doubt that in origin here, as in the
other wine-festivals, the deity concerned was at first Iuppiter. Among
the other rustic ceremonies of the month we may notice the festival of
springs (<i>Fontinalia</i>) on October 13: wells were decorated with
garlands and flowers flung into the waters.</p>

<p><b>3. Festivals of the Winter.</b>&mdash;The winter-festivals cannot be summed
up under one general <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>notion so easily as those of spring or summer,
but they fall fairly naturally into two groups&mdash;the festivals
immediately connected with agricultural life and those associated with
the dead and the underworld or with solemn purification. The main
action of the farmer's life during the winter is, of course, the
sowing of the next year's crop, which was commemorated in the ancient
festival of the Saturnalia on December 17. Though the Saturnalia is
perhaps the most familiar to us of all the Roman festivals, partly
from the allusions in the classics, especially in Horace, partly
because it is no doubt the source of many of our own Christmas
festivities, it is yet almost impossible now to recover anything of
its original Roman character. Greek influence set to work on it very
early, identifying Saturnus with Cronos and establishing him in a
Greek temple with all the accompaniments of Greek ritual. All the
familiar features of the festival&mdash;the freedom and license of the
slaves, the giving of presents, even the wax-candles, which are the
prototype of those on our own Christmas-tree&mdash;are almost certainly due
to Greek origin. We are left with nothing but the name Saturnus
(connected with the root of <i>semen</i>, <i>serere</i>) and the date to assure
us that we have here in reality a genuine Roman festival of the sowing
of <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>the crops. Of a similar nature&mdash;marking, as Ovid tells us, the
completion of the sowing&mdash;was the <i>feriae sementivae</i> or Paganalia,
associated with the earth-goddesses, Ceres and Tellus. Meal-cakes and
a pregnant sow were the offerings, the beasts who had helped in the
ploughing were garlanded, and prayer was made for the seed resting in
the ground. A curious feature of the winter worship is the repetition
of festivals to the harvest deities, Consus and Ops, separated by the
same interval of three days, on December 15 and 19: it may be that we
have here an indication of the final completion of the harvest, or, as
Mr. Warde Fowler has suggested, a ceremonial opening of the
storehouses, to see that the harvest is not rotting. Among the other
country festivals of the period we may notice that of Carmenta, on the
11th and 15th of January: she seems to have been in origin a
water-<i>numen</i>, but was early associated with childbirth: hence the
rigid exclusion of men from her ceremonies and possibly the taboo on
leathern thongs, on the ground that nothing involving death must be
used in the worship of a deity of birth. The repetition of her
festival may possibly point to separate celebrations of the
communities of Palatine and Quirinal. At this time, too, occurred the
rustic ceremonies <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>at the boundaries (<i>Terminalia</i>) and the offering
to the Lares at the 'marches' (<i>Compitalia</i>), of which we have spoken
in treating of the worship of the house.</p>

<p>The other group of winter-festivals is of a much more gloomy and less
definitely rustic type, though they clearly date from the period of
the agricultural community. Of the Feralia of February 21, the
culmination of the festival of the kindred dead (<i>Parentalia</i>), we
have already spoken. The Larentalia is a very mysterious occasion, and
was supposed by the Romans themselves to be an offering 'at the tomb'
of a legendary Acca Larentia, mistress of Hercules. But we have seen
reason to think that Larentia was in reality a deity of the dead, and
the 'tomb' a <i>mundus</i>: if so, we have another link between the winter
season and the worship of the underworld. There remains the weird
festival of the Lupercalia on February 15, to which we have had
occasion to refer several times, and which has become more familiar to
most of us than other Roman festivals owing to its political use by
Mark Antony in 44 <span class="fakesc">B.C.</span> As we have argued already, it seems to
belong to the very oldest stratum of the Palatine settlement, and we
may therefore appropriately close this account of the early festivals
with a <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>somewhat fuller description of it. The worshippers assembled
at the Lupercal, a cave on the Palatine hill: there goats and a dog
were sacrificed, and two youths belonging to the two colleges of
Fabian and Quintian (or Quintilian) Luperci had their foreheads
smeared with the knife used for the sacrifice and wiped with wool
dipped in milk&mdash;at which point it was ordained that they should laugh.
Then they girt on the skins of the slain goats and, after feasting,
ran their course round the boundaries of the Palatine hill, followed
each by his own company of youths, and striking women on their way
with strips, known as <i>februae</i> or <i>Iunonis amicula</i>, cut from the
goats' hides. Here we have a summary of many of the important points
which we have noticed in the rustic festivals: from the pre-Roman
stratum comes the idea of communion with the sacrificed animal in the
smearing of the blood and the wearing of the skin, and also the magic
charm involved in the striking of the women to procure fertility: it
is typical of the true feeling of Roman religion that we cannot with
any certainty tell what deity was associated with the rite, though
probably it was Faunus: the rustic character of the ceremony is
indicated by the bowl of milk in which the wool was dipped and the
sacrifice of <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>goats: the idea of lustration is clearly marked in the
course round the boundaries: the original Palatine settlement stands
out in the limits of that course and the site of the Lupercal, and the
later syn&oelig;cismus is seen in the, presumably subsequent, addition of
the second college of Luperci. A careful study of the Lupercalia as an
epitome of the character and development of the Roman agricultural
festivals, though it would not show the brighter aspect of some of the
spring and summer celebrations, would yet give a true notion of the
history and spirit of the whole.</p>

<h4>WORSHIP OF THE STATE</h4>
<br />

<p>Since, in the matter of religion, the Roman state is in the main but
the agricultural household magnified, we shall not, in considering its
worship, be entering on a new stratum of ideas, but rather looking at
the development of notions and sentiments already familiar. To deal,
however, with the state-worship in full would not only far exceed the
limits of this sketch, but would lead us away from religious ideas
into the region of what we might now call 'ecclesiastical management.'
I propose therefore to confine myself to two points, firstly, the
broadening of the old conceptions of the household and the fields and
their adaptation to the life of the state, and secondly&mdash;to be treated
very shortly and as an indication of the Roman character&mdash;the
organisation of religion.</p>

<p><b>1. Development of the Worship of House and Fields.</b>&mdash;Here we shall
find two main <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>characteristics. The state in the first place, as we
have several times hinted in anticipation, establishes its own
counterpart of the household and rustic cults and adapts to its own
use the ideas which they involve: in the second, and particularly in
connection with some of the field-deities, it evolves new and very
frequently abstract notions, foreign to the life of the independent
country households, but necessary and vital to the life of an
organised community. Let us look first at the fate of the household
deities.</p>

<p><b>Ianus.</b>&mdash;We left Ianus as the <i>numen</i> of the house-door: he passes
into the state exactly in the same capacity: the state too has its
'door,' the gate at the north-east corner of the Forum, and this
becomes the seat of his state-cult&mdash;the door which, according to
Augustan legend, is opened in the time of war and only shut when Rome
is at peace with all the world. But reflection soon gets to work on
Ianus: a door has two sides, it can both open and shut; therefore, as
early as the song of the Salii, he has developed the cult-epithets
'Opener,' 'Shutter' (<i>Patulci</i>, <i>Cloesi</i>), and as soon as he is
thought of as anything approaching a personality he is 'two-headed'
(<i>bifrons</i>), as he appears in later representations. The door again is
the first thing you come to in entering <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>a house: the 'door-spirit'
then, with that tendency to abstraction which we shall see shortly in
other cases, becomes the god of beginnings. He watches over the very
first beginning of human life in his character of <i>Consevius</i>; to him
is sacred the first hour of the day (<i>pater matutinus</i>), the Calends
of every month, and the first month of the year (<i>Ianuarius</i>); to him
too is offered by the <i>rex sacrorum</i> the first sacrifice of the year,
the Agonium on the 9th of January. In this capacity, moreover, his
name comes first in all the formul&aelig; of prayer, and he is looked
upon&mdash;not indeed as the father of the gods&mdash;for that is a much too
anthropomorphic notion&mdash;but as what we might now term their 'logical
antecedent': <i>divum deus</i>, as the song of the Salii quaintly puts it,
<i>principium deorum</i>, as later interpretation explained it. Yet through
all he remains the most typical Roman deity: he does not acquire a
temple till 217 <span class="fakesc">B.C.</span>, nor a bust until quite late, nor is he
ever identified with a Greek counterpart. In his capacity as <i>pater
matutinus</i> he has a native female counterpart in Matuta, a dawn-deity,
who becomes a protectress in childbirth, and as such is the centre of
the matrons' festival, the Matralia of June 11.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span><b>Vesta.</b>&mdash;The history of Vesta is perhaps less romantic, but it
affords a more exact parallel between household and state. In the
primitive community the king's hearth is not merely of symbolical
importance, but of great practical utility, in that it is kept
continually burning as the source of fire on which the individual
householder may draw: hence it is the duty of the king's daughters to
care for it and keep the flame perpetually alight. In Rome the temple
of Vesta is the king's hearth, situated, as one would expect, in close
proximity to the <i>regia</i>. The fire is kept continually blazing except
on the 1st of March of every year, when it is allowed to go out and is
ceremonially renewed. The Vestal virgins, sworn to perpetual virginity
and charged with the preservation of the sacred flame, are 'the king's
daughters,' living in a kind of convent (<i>atrium Vest&aelig;</i>) and under the
charge of the king's representative, the <i>pontifex maximus</i>. It is
their duty too, as the natural cooks of the sacred royal household, to
make the salt cake (<i>mola salsa</i>) to be used at the year's festivals
and to preserve it and other sacred objects, such as the ashes of the
Fordicidia, in the storehouse of Vesta (<i>penus Vest&aelig;</i>). In the month
of June from the 7th to the 15th, with a climax on the 9th, the day
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>of the Vestalia, the matrons who all the year round have tended their
own hearths, come in solemn procession bare-footed to make their
homely offerings at the state-hearth, and the virgins meanwhile offer
the cakes that they have made. For eight days the ceremony continues,
during which time the bakers and millers keep holiday; the days are
<i>religiosi</i> (marriages are unlucky and other taboos are observed) and
also <i>nefasti</i> (no public business may be performed); until the
ceremony closes on the 15th, with the solemn cleansing of the temple
and the casting of the refuse into the Tiber, and then the normal life
of the state may be renewed&mdash;Q. St. D. F. (<i>Quando Stercus Delatum
Fas</i>) is the unique entry in the Calendars. This is all less
imaginative than the development of Ianus, but the underlying feeling
is intensely Roman and there could be no clearer idea of the natural
adaptation of the household-cult to the religion of the state.</p>

<p><b>Penates, Lares, and Genius.</b>&mdash;The other household deities too have
their counterpart, though not so prominently marked, in the worship of
the state. The magistrates, on entering office, took oath by Iuppiter
and the <i>Di Penates populi Romani Quiritium</i>, and that the conception
was as wide in the <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>state as in the household is shown by the fact
that on less formal occasions the formula appears as <i>Iuppiter et
ceteri di omnes immortales</i>. The Penates of the state then would
include all the state-deities; but that their original character is
not lost sight of we can see from the statement of Varro that in the
<i>penus Vest&aelig;</i> (the 'state storehouse') were preserved their
<i>sigilla</i>&mdash;not apparently sensuous representations, but symbolic
objects, such as we have seen before in cases like that of the <i>silex</i>
of Iuppiter. The <i>Lares</i> again find their counterpart in the <i>Lares
Praestites</i> of the state, and their rustic festival, the Compitalia,
has its urban reproduction, which, as it involved considerable license
on the part of populace and slaves, was often in the later period of
the Republic a cause of serious political disturbance. Even the
Genius, though rather vaguely, passes over to the state and we hear of
the <i>Genius populi Romani</i> or the <i>Genius urbis Rom&aelig;</i>, with regard to
which Servius quotes from an inscription on a shield the
characteristic addition, <i>sive mas sive femina</i>: in much later times
we find the exact counterpart of the domestic worship of the Genius of
the <i>pater familias</i> in the cult of the Genius of the Emperor&mdash;the
foundation of the whole of the imperial worship.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>We have observed already how the cults of the fields were taken over
by the state and their counterparts established in the great festivals
of the Calendar. Naturally enough most of the deities concerned,
existing only for the part they played in these festivals, retained
their original character without further development. But with a few
it was different: it was their fate to acquire new characteristics and
new functions, and, developing with the needs of the community, to
become the great gods of the state: of these we must give some brief
account.</p>

<p><b>Iuppiter.</b>&mdash;We have known Iuppiter hitherto either in connection with
certain very primitive survivals, or in the genuine Roman period as a
sky-<i>numen</i>, concerned with the grape-harvest in the two Vinalia and
the Meditrinalia, and the recipient at the family meal of a <i>daps</i> as
a general propitiation before the beginning of the sowing. As sky-god
he passes to the state: <i>Lucetius</i> (<i>lux</i>) is his title in the song of
the Salii and to him are sacred the Ides of every month&mdash;the time of
the full moon, when there is most light in the heavens by night as
well as day. In his agricultural connection he has his wine-festivals
in the state as in the country, and the household <i>daps</i> becomes the
more elaborate <i>epulum Iovis</i>, <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>in which the whole community, as it
were, entertained him at a banquet. As a sky-deity, too, he is
particularly concerned with the thunderbolt and the lightning-flash
(<i>Iuppiter Fulmen</i>, <i>Fulgur</i>), and to him are sacred the always
ominous spots which had been struck by lightning (<i>bidentalia</i>): with
the more alarming occurrence of lightning by night he has a special
connection under the cult-title <i>Iuppiter Summanus</i>. But as the little
community grew, and especially perhaps after the union of the two
settlements, the worship of Iuppiter Feretrius, associated with the
sacred oak upon the Capitol&mdash;the hill between Palatine and
Quirinal&mdash;comes more and more into prominence as a bond of union and
the central point of the state's religious life: it tends indeed to
take the place of priority, which had previously been occupied by
Ianus. The community goes to war with its neighbours, and after a
signal victory the <i>spolia opima</i> must be dedicated on the sacred oak:
indeed Iuppiter is in a special sense with them in the battle and must
now be worshipped as the 'stayer of rout' (<i>Stator</i>) and the 'giver of
victory' (<i>Victor</i>). War is a new province of the state's activity,
but, characteristically enough, it does not evolve its own <i>numen</i>,
but enlarges the sphere of the somewhat elastic <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>spirits already
existing. So too in the internal organisation of the state there is
felt the need of a religious sanction for public morality, and
Iuppiter&mdash;though vaguely at first&mdash;takes on him the character of a
deity of justice. In this connection he is primarily the god of oaths:
we have seen how his sacred <i>silex</i> was used in the oath of treaty: it
is also the most solemn witness to the oath of the citizen. Iuppiter
Lapis becomes specially the Dius Fidius, a cult-title which
subsequently sets up for itself and produces a further offshoot in the
abstract Fides. Finally, towards the end of our period the Iuppiter of
the Capitol emerges triumphant, as it were, from his struggle with his
rivals and, with the new title of Iuppiter Optimus Maximus,&mdash;the 'best
and greatest,' that is, of all the Iuppiters&mdash;takes his place as the
supreme deity of the Roman state and the personification of the
greatness and majesty of Rome itself. To his temple hereafter the
Roman youth will come to make his offering when he takes the dress of
manhood; here the magistrates will do sacrifice before entering on
their year of office: here the victorious general will pass in
procession with the spoils of his victory: on the walls shall be
suspended treaties with foreign nations and <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>offerings sent by subject
princes and states from all quarters of the world: all that Rome is to
be, will be, as it were, embodied in the sky-spirit of the sacred oak,
the god of justice and of victory in war.</p>

<p><b>Iuno.</b>&mdash;Iuppiter carries with him into the state-worship his female
counterpart, Iuno, with his own characteristics, in a certain degree,
and his own privileges. She is Lucina and Fulgura as he is Lucetius and
Fulgur: white cows are her offerings as white steers are his: as the
Ides are sacred to Iuppiter, so&mdash;though they are not a festival&mdash;are
the Calends to Iuno. But from the first she shows a certain
independence and develops on lines of her own. In the curious ceremony
of the fixing of the Nones (the first quarter of the month), held on
the Calends in the <i>curia Calabra</i>, she seems to appear as a
moon-goddess: the <i>rex sacrorum</i>, after a report from a <i>pontifex</i> as
to the appearance of the new moon, announces the result in the formula:
'I summon thee for five (or seven) days, hollow Iuno' (<i>dies te
quinque</i> [<i>septem</i>] <i>kalo, Iuno Covella</i>: hence the name <i>Kalendae</i>).
But far more prominently&mdash;either as a female divinity herself, or, as
some think, owing to the supposed influence of the moon on female
life&mdash;does Iuno figure as the <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>deity of women, and especially in
association with childbirth and marriage. As <i>Lucina</i> she is, as we
have seen, the presiding deity of childbirth, and her festival on the
1st of March, though not in the Calendars (because confined to women
and not therefore a festival of the whole people), attained immense
popularity under the title of the Matronalia. She has too a general
superintendence of the rites of marriage, and the various little
<i>numina</i>, who play so prominent a part in the ceremonies, tend to
attach themselves to her as cult-titles. The festival of the
servant-maids in honour of Iuno Caprotina on the 7th of July shows the
same notion of Iuno as the women's goddess, which appears again in
common parlance when women speak of their Iuno, just as men do of their
Genius. Later on Iuno acquires the characteristics of majesty
(<i>Regina</i>) and protection in war (<i>Curitis</i>, <i>Sospita</i>), partly no
doubt as Iuppiter's counterpart, but more directly through the
introduction of cults from neighbouring Italian towns.</p>

<p><b>Mars.</b>&mdash;We have seen reason to believe that in the earlier stages of
Roman religion Mars was a <i>numen</i> of vegetation, but though the
Ambarvalia was duly taken over into the state-cult and attained a very
high degree of importance, yet <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>there can be no doubt that in the
state-religion Mars was pre-eminently associated with war. Iuppiter
might help at need in averting defeat and awarding victory, but it was
with Mars that the general conduct of war rested. His sacred animal is
the warlike wolf, his symbols the spears and the sacred shields
(<i>ancilia</i>), which during his own month (<i>Martius</i>)&mdash;the 1st of which
is his special festival&mdash;his priests (<i>Salii</i>) wearing the full
war-dress (<i>trabea</i> and <i>tunica picta</i>) carry with sacred dance and
song round the city. His altar is in the Campus Martius, outside the
city-walls and therefore within the sphere of the <i>imperium militiae</i>,
and the other festivals associated with him are of a warlike
character: the races of the war-horse (Equirria) on March 14 and
February 27, and the great race on the Ides of October, when the
winner was solemnly slain: the lustration of the arms at the
Quinquatrus on March 19 and the Armilustrium of October 19&mdash;at the
beginning and end of the campaigning season: and the lustration of the
war-trumpets on the 23rd of March and the 23rd of May. But above all
in honour of Mars is held the great quinquennial <i>lustrum</i> associated
with the census, when the people are drawn up in military array around
his altar in <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>the Campus Martius and the solemn offering of the
<i>suovetaurilia</i> (is this a faint relic of his agricultural character?)
after being carried three times round the gathered host, is offered on
his altar in prayer for the military future of the state. Hardly any
god in the state-cult has his character so clearly marked, and we may
regard Mars as a deity who, taking on new functions to suit the needs
of the times, almost entirely lost the traces of his original nature.</p>

<p><b>Quirinus.</b>&mdash;Iuppiter and Mars then became the great state-deities of
the developed community and to them is added, as the contribution of
the Colline settlement, their own particular deity, Quirinus. He, like
them, has his own <i>flamen</i>; like Mars he has his <i>Salii</i>, and his
festival finds its place in the Calendars on February the 17th. But of
his ritual and character we know practically nothing: the ritual was
obscured because his festival coincided with the much more popular
festival of the <i>curiae</i>, the <i>stultorum feriae</i>: of his character, we
can only conjecture that he was to the Colline settlement what Mars
was to the Palatine, whereas later after the complete amalgamation he
seems to have been distinguished from Mars as representing 'armed
peace' rather than war&mdash;an idea which is borne out by the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>associations of the closely allied word <i>Quirites</i>. Be that as it may,
we have in Iuppiter, Mars, and Quirinus the great state-triad of the
syn&oelig;cismus, who held their own until at the beginning of the next
epoch they were supplanted by the new Etruscan triad of the Capitol,
Iuppiter, Iuno and Minerva.</p>

<p><b>2. Organisation.</b>&mdash;It might perhaps be thought that the organisation
of religion is a matter remote from its spirit, and is not therefore a
suitable subject for discussion, where the object is rather to bring
out underlying motives and ideas: but in dealing with the Roman
religion, where ceremonial and legal precision were so prominent, it
would be even misleading to omit some reference to the very
characteristic manner in which the state, taking over the rather
chaotic elements of the agricultural worship, organised them into
something like a consistent whole. Its most complete achievement in
this direction was without doubt the regulation of the religious year.
We have spoken many times of the Calendars (<i>Fasti</i>): it is necessary
now to obtain some clearer notion of what they were. In Rome itself
and various Italian towns have been found some thirty inscriptions,
one almost complete (Maffeiani), the others more or less fragmentary,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>giving the tables of the months and marking precisely the character
and occurrences of every day in the year. We may take as a specimen
the latter half of the month of August from the Fasti Maffeiani.</p>

<p>In the first column are given the nundinal letters of the days,
showing their position in the eight days' 'week' from one market day
(<i>nundinae</i>) to the next. In the second column are noted first the
great divisions of the month, Calends, Nones, and Ides, and then the
religious character of each individual day is indicated by certain
signs, whose explanations throw a good deal of light on Roman
religions notions. It will be seen that the letters of most frequent
occurrence are <span class="fakesc">F</span>, <span class="fakesc">C</span>, and <span class="fakesc">N</span> (or in our
extract <span class="np">NP&nbsp;</span>): these correspond to the broad distinction
between <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>days profane and sacred. <span class="fakesc">F</span> (<i>fastus</i>) denotes a day
on which the business of the state may be performed, on which the
praetor may say (<i>fari</i>) the three words, <i>do, dico, addico</i>, which
summed up the decisions of the Roman law: <span class="fakesc">C</span> (<i>comitialis</i>)
marks a day on which the legislative assemblies (<i>comitia</i>) may be
held: it is by implication <span class="fakesc">F</span> as well. <span class="fakesc">N</span>
(<i>nefastus</i>), on the other hand, denotes the sacred day, consecrated
to the worship of the gods, on which therefore state-business may not
be transacted: similarly the very mysterious and much disputed sign
<span class="np">NP</span>, whether it differs in precise signification from
<span class="fakesc">N</span> or not, certainly marks a day of sacred character.
<span class="fakesc">EN</span>, which occurs once in this extract (from <i>endotercisus</i>,
the old Latin form of <i>intercisus</i>) signifies a 'split' day (<i>dies
fissus</i>), the beginning and end of which were sacred, while the middle
period was free for business. In the second column also (in large
letters in some of the other Calendars) are named the <i>feriae
publicae</i>, the great annual state-festivals, fixed for one particular
day (<i>feriae stativae</i>): such, in this case, are the Portunalia,
Vinalia, and Consualia.</p>

<p>These <i>fasti</i> were exhibited in the Forum and on the walls of temples,
and the conscientious Roman could have no possible difficulty in
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>finding out when he might lawfully transact his business and what
festivals the state was observing: of the 355 days of the old Calendar
11 were <i>fissi</i>, 235 were <i>fasti</i> (192 <i>comitiales</i>), and 109
<i>nefasti</i>. We may remark as curious features in the Calendar, denoting
rigid adherence to principle, that with one exception, the Poplifugia
of July 5, no festival ever occurs before the Nones, that with two
exceptions, the Regifugium of February 24 and the Equirria of the 14th
of March, no festival falls on an even day of the month, and that
there is a marked avoidance of successive feast-days: even the three
days of the Lemuria allow an interval of a day between each.</p>

<p>In the matter of ritual and observance, state-organisation&mdash;and its
absence&mdash;are alike significant. Of the general exactness of ritual and
its specific variations on different occasions a fair notion has
perhaps already been gathered; it may help to fill out that notion if
we can put together a sketch of the normal process of a sacrifice to
the gods. Before the sacrifice began the animal to be offered was
selected and tested: if it had any blemish or showed any reluctance,
it was rejected. If it were whole and willing, it was bound with
fillets (<i>infulae</i>) around its <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>forehead, and long ribbons (<i>vittae</i>)
depending from them. It was then brought to the altar (<i>ara</i>) by the
side of which stood a portable brazier (<i>foculus</i>). The
celebrant&mdash;magistrate or priest&mdash;next approached dressed in the
<i>toga</i>, girt about him in a peculiar manner (<i>cinctus Gabinus</i>), and
carried up at the back so as to form a hood (<i>velato capite</i>): the
herald proclaimed silence, and the flute-player began to play his
instrument. The first part of the offering was then made by the
pouring of wine and scattering of incense on the brazier: it was
followed by the ceremonial slaughter (<i>immolatio</i>) of the animal. The
celebrant sprinkled the victim with wine and salted cake, and made a
symbolic gesture with the knife. The victim was then taken aside by
the attendants (<i>victimarii</i>), and actually slaughtered by them: from
it they extracted the sacred parts (<i>exta</i>), liver, heart, gall,
lungs, and midriff, and after inspecting them to see that they had no
abnormality&mdash;but not in the earlier period for purposes of
augury&mdash;wrapped them in pieces of flesh (<i>augmenta</i>), cooked them, and
brought them back to the celebrant, who laid them as an offering upon
the altar, where they were burnt. The rest of the flesh (<i>viscera</i>)
was divided as a sacred meal between the celebrant and his friends&mdash;or
in <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>a state-offering among the priests, and probably the magistrate.
We cannot refrain from remarking here the extreme precision of ritual,
the scrupulous care with which the human side of the contract was
fulfilled and the&mdash;almost legal&mdash;division of the victim between gods
and men. But though the ritual was so exact, one must not be led away
by modern analogies to suppose that there was ever anything like a
rigid constraint on the private citizen for the observance of
festivals. The state-festivals were in the strictest sense offerings
made to the gods by the representative magistrates or priests, and if
they were present, all was done that was required: the whole people
had been, by a legal fiction, present in their persons. No doubt the
private citizen would often attend in large numbers at the
celebrations, especially at the more popular festivals, but from some,
such as the Vestalia, he was actually excluded. On the other hand,
though it did not demand presence, the state did&mdash;at least
theoretically&mdash;demand the observance of the feast-day by private
individuals. The root-notion of <i>feriae</i> was a day set apart for the
worship of the gods, and on it therefore the citizen ought to do 'no
manner of work.' The state observed this condition fully in the
closing <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>of law-courts and the absence of legislative assemblies, and
in theory too the private citizen must refrain from any act which was
not concerned with the worship of the gods, or rendered absolutely
necessary, as, for instance, if 'his ox or his ass should fall into a
pit.' But it is characteristic of Rome that the state did not seek for
offence, but only punished it if accidentally seen: on a feast-day the
<i>rex sacrorum</i> and the <i>flamines</i> might not see work being done; they
therefore sent on a herald in advance to announce their presence, and
an actual conviction involved a money-fine. Perhaps more scrupulously
than the <i>feriae</i> were observed the <i>dies religiosi</i>, days of
'abstinence,' on which certain acts, such as marriage, the beginning
of any new piece of work, or the offering of sacrifice to the gods,
were forbidden: such, in the oldest period, were the days on which the
<i>mundus</i> was open, or the temple of Vesta received the matrons, the
days when the Salii carried the <i>ancilia</i> in procession, and the
periods of the two festivals of the dead in February and May; but for
eluding their observance too devices were not unknown.</p>

<p>In the state-organisation of religion, then, we seem to see just the
same features from which we started: as a basis the legal conception
of <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>the relation of god to man, as a result the extreme care and
precision in times and ceremonials, as a corollary in the state the
idea of legal representation and the consequent looseness of hold on
the action of the individual.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER VIII<span class="totoc"><a href="#toc">ToC</a></span></h3>

<h4>AUGURIES AND AUSPICES</h4>
<br />

<p>So far we have been considering the regular relations of man and god,
seen in recurring or special offerings, in vows and in acts of
purification and lustration&mdash;all based on the contract-notion, all
endeavours on man's part to fulfil his bounden duty, that the gods may
be constrained in turn to theirs. But so strong was the feeling of
divine presence and influence in the Roman's mind, that he was not
content with doing his best by these regular means to secure the
favour of the gods, but wished before undertaking any business of
importance to be able to assure himself of their approval. His
practical common-sense evolved, as it were, a complete 'code'&mdash;in the
flight and song of birds, in the direction of the lightning-flash, in
the conduct of men and animals&mdash;by which he believed that the gods
communicated to him their intentions: sometimes these indications
(<i>auspicia</i>) might be vouchsafed by the gods <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>unasked (<i>oblativa</i>),
sometimes they would be given in answer to request (<i>impetrativa</i>):
but as to their meaning, there could be no doubt, provided they were
interpreted by one skilled in the lore and tradition of augury. We may
observe here, though our evidence is much slighter, the same three
stages which we have noticed in the sacrificial worship, the homely
domestic auspices, the auguries of the agricultural life, and the
organised system in the state.</p>

<p>In the household the use of auspices was in origin at any rate very
general indeed: 'Nothing,' Cicero tells us, 'of importance used to be
undertaken unless with the sanction of the auspices' (<i>auspicato</i>).
The right of interrogating the will of the gods, rested, as one might
expect, with the master of the house, assisted no doubt by the private
augur as the repository of lore and the interpreter of what the master
saw. But of the details of domestic augury we know but little. Cato in
one passage insists on the extreme importance of silence for the
purpose, and Festus suggests that this was secured by the master of
the house rising in the depths of the night to inspect the heavens. We
have seen already that the taking of the auspices played <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>an important
part in the ceremonies of betrothal and marriage, and that the
indications of the divine will might be very varied we may gather from
a story in Cicero. An aunt wishing to take the auspices for her
niece's betrothal, conducted her into an open consecrated space
(<i>sacellum</i>) and sat down on the stool of augury (<i>sella</i>) with her
niece standing at her side. After a while the girl tired and asked her
aunt to give her a little of the stool: the aunt replied, 'My child, I
give up my seat to you': nothing further happened and this answer
turned out in fact to be the auspicious sign: the aunt died, the niece
married the widower and so became mistress of the house.</p>

<p>Of augury in agricultural life we have some indication in the annual
observance of the 'spring augury' (<i>augurium verniserum</i>) and the
midsummer ceremony of the <i>augurium canarium</i>, which seems to have
been a combination of the offering of a red dog (possibly to avert
mildew) and an augury for the success of the crops. To the rustic
stratum possibly belongs also the <i>augurium salutis populi</i>, though
later it was a yearly act celebrated whenever the Roman army was not
at war and so became connected with the shutting of the temple of
Ianus.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>The state greatly developed and organised the whole system of auguries
and auspices. The college of augurs ranked second only in importance
to the pontifical college, and their duties with regard to both augury
and auspice are sufficiently clear. Like the <i>pontifices</i> in relation
to cult, they are the storehouse of all tradition, and to them appeal
may be made in all cases of doubt both public and private: they were
jealous of their secrets and in later times their mutual consciousness
of deception became proverbial. The right of augury&mdash;in origin simply
the inspection of the heavens&mdash;was theirs alone, and it was exercised
particularly on the annual occasions mentioned and at the installation
of priests, of which we get a typical instance in Livy's account of
the consecration of Numa.</p>

<p>The auspices on the other hand&mdash;in origin 'signs from birds' (<i>avis</i>,
<i>spicere</i>)&mdash;were the province of the magistrate about to undertake
some definite action on behalf of the state whether at home or on the
field of battle. Here the augur's functions were merely preparatory
and advisory. It was his duty to prepare the <i>templum</i>, the spot from
which the auspices are to be taken&mdash;always a square space, with
boundaries <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>unbroken except at the entrance, not surrounded by wall or
necessarily by line, but clearly indicated (<i>effatus</i>) by the augur,
and marked off (<i>liberatus</i>) from the surroundings: in the comitia and
other places in Rome there were permanent <i>templa</i>, but elsewhere they
must be specially made. The magistrate then enters the <i>templum</i> and
observes the signs (<i>spectio</i>): if there is any doubt as to
interpretation&mdash;and seeing the immense complication of the traditions
(<i>disciplina</i>), this must often have been the case&mdash;the augur is
referred to as interpreter. The signs demanded (<i>impetrativa</i>) were
originally always connected with the appearance, song or flight of
birds&mdash;higher or lower, from left to right or right to left, etc.
Later others were included, and with the army in the field it became
the regular practice to take the auspices from the feeding of the
sacred chickens (<i>pulli</i>): the best sign being obtained if, in their
eagerness to feed, they let fall some of the grain from their beaks
(<i>tripudium solistimum</i>)&mdash;a result not difficult to secure by previous
treatment and a careful selection of the kind of grain supplied to
them. But besides this deliberate 'asking for signs,' public business
might at any moment be interrupted if the gods voluntarily sent an
indication of <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>disapproval (<i>oblativa</i>): the augurs then had always to
be at hand to advise the magistrates whether notice should be taken of
such signs, and, if so, what was their signification, and they even
seem to have had certain rights of reporting themselves (<i>nuntiatio</i>)
the occurrence of adverse ones. The sign of most usual occurrence
would be lightning&mdash;sometimes such an unexpected event as the seizure
of a member of the assembly with epilepsy (<i>morbus comitialis</i>)&mdash;and
we know to what lengths political obstructionists went in later times
in the observation of fictitious signs, or even the prevention of
business by the mere announcement of their intention to see an
unfavourable omen (<i>servare de caelo</i>). The complications and
ramifications of the augur's art are infinite, but the main idea
should by now be plain, and it must be remembered that the kindred art
of the soothsayer (<i>haruspex</i>), oracles, and the interpretation of
fate by the drawing of lots (<i>sortes</i>) are all later foreign
introductions: auspice and augury are the only genuine Roman methods
for interpreting the will of the gods.</p>

<p>Here then in household, fields, and state, we have a second type of
relation to the gods, running parallel to the ordinary practice of
sacrifice and prayer, distinct yet not <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>fundamentally different. As it
is man's function to propitiate the higher spirits and prevent, if
possible, the wrecking of his plans by their opposition, so it is his
business, if he can, to find out their intentions before he engages on
any serious undertaking. As in the <i>ius sacrum</i> his legal mind leads
him to assume that the deities accept the responsibility of the
contract, when his own part is fulfilled, so here, like a practical
man of business, he assumes their construction of a code of
communication, which he has learned to interpret. In its origin it is
a notion common to many primitive religions, but in its elaboration it
is peculiarly and distinctively Italian, and, as we know it, Roman.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER IX<span class="totoc"><a href="#toc">ToC</a></span></h3>

<h4>RELIGION AND MORALITY&mdash;CONCLUSION</h4>
<br />

<p>It might be said that a religion&mdash;the expression of man's relation to
the unseen&mdash;has not necessarily any connection with morality&mdash;man's
action in himself and towards his neighbours: that an individual&mdash;or
even a nation&mdash;might perfectly fulfil the duties imposed by the
'powers above,' without being influenced in conduct and character.
Such a view might seem to find an apt illustration in the religion of
Rome: the ceremonial <i>pietas</i> towards the gods appears to have little
to do with the making of man or nation. But in the history of the
world the test of religions must be their effect on the character of
those who believed in them: religion is no doubt itself an outcome of
character, but it reacts upon it, and must either strengthen or
weaken. We are not therefore justified in dismissing the 'Religion of
Numa' without inquiry as to its relation to <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>morality, for on our
answer to that question must largely depend our judgment as to its
value.</p>

<p>We are of course in a peculiarly difficult position to grapple with
this problem through lack of contemporary evidence. The Rome we know,
in the epochs when we can fairly judge of character and morality, was
not the Rome in which the 'Religion of Numa' had grown up and remained
unquestioned: it had been overlaid with foreign cults and foreign
ideas, had been used by priests and magistrates as a political
instrument, and discounted among the educated through the influence of
philosophy. But we may remember in the first place that even then,
especially in the household and in the country, the old religion had
probably a much firmer hold than one might imagine from literary
evidence, in the second that national character is not the growth of a
day, so that we may safely refer permanent characteristics to the
period when the old religion held its own.</p>

<p>It may be admitted at once that the direct influence on morality was
very small indeed. There was no table of commandments backed by the
religious sanction: the sense of 'sin,' except through breach of
ritual, was practically <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>unknown. It is true that in the very early
<i>leges regiae</i> some notion of this kind is seen&mdash;a significant glimpse
of what the original relation may have been: it is there ordained that
the patron who betrayed his client, or the client who deceived his
patron, shall be condemned to Iuppiter; the parricide to the spirits
of his dead ancestors, the husband who sells his wife to the gods of
the underworld, the man who removes his neighbour's landmark to
Terminus, the stealer of corn to Ceres. All these persons shall be
<i>sacri</i>: they have offended against the gods and the gods will see to
their punishment. But these are old-world notions which soon passed
into the background and the state took over the punishment of such
offenders in the ordinary course of law. Nor again in the prayers of
men to gods is there a trace of a petition for moral blessings: the
magistrate prays for the success and prosperity of the state, the
farmer for the fertility of his crops and herds, even the private
individual, who suspends his votive-tablet in the temple, pays his due
for health or commercial success vouchsafed to himself or his
relations. 'Men call Iuppiter greatest and best,' says Cicero,
'because he makes us not just or temperate or wise, but sound and
healthy and rich and wealthy.' Still less, until <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>we come to the
moralists of the Empire, is there any sense of that immediate and
personal relation of the individual to a higher being, which is really
in religion, far more than commandments and ordinances, the mainspring
and safeguard of morality: even the conception of the Genius, the
'nearest' perhaps of all unseen powers, had nothing of this feeling in
it, and it may be significant that, just because of his nearness to
man, the Genius never quite attained to god-head. As far as direct
relation is concerned, religion and morality were to the Roman two
independent spheres with a very small point of contact.</p>

<p>Nor even in its indirect influence does the formal observance of the
Roman worship seem likely at first sight to have done much for
personal or national morality. Based upon fear, stereotyped in the
form of a legal relationship, <i>religio</i>&mdash;'the bounden
obligation'&mdash;made, no doubt, for a kind of conscientiousness in its
adherents, but a cold conscientiousness, devoid of emotion and
incapable of expanding itself to include other spheres or prompt to a
similar scrupulousness in other relations. The rigid and constant
distinction of sacred and profane would incline the Roman to fulfil
the routine of his <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>religious duty and then turn, almost with a sigh
of relief, to the occupations of normal life, carrying with him
nothing more than the sense of a burden laid aside and a pledge of
external prosperity. Even the religious act itself might be without
moral significance: as we have seen, the worshipper might be wholly
ignorant of the character, even the name of the deity he worshipped,
and in any case the motive of his action was naught, the act itself
everything. Nor again had the Roman religion any trace of that
powerful incentive to morality, a doctrine of rewards and punishments
in a future life: the ideas as to the fate of the dead were
fluctuating and vague, and the Roman was in any case much more
interested in their influence on himself than in their possible
experiences after death.</p>

<p>The divorce then between religion and morality seems almost complete
and it is not strange that most modern writers speak of the Roman
religion as a tiresome ritual formalism, almost wholly lacking in
ethical value. And yet it did not present itself in this light to the
Romans themselves. Cicero, sceptic as he was, could speak of it as the
cause of Rome's greatness; Augustus, the practical politician, could
believe that its revival was an essential condition for the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>renaissance of the Roman character. Have we, in our brief examination
of its characteristics, seen any features which may suggest the
solution of this apparent antagonism? Was there in this formalism a
life which escapes us, as we handle the dry bones of antiquarianism?</p>

<p>In the first place there may be a danger that we underrate the value
of formalism itself. It spells routine, but routine is not without
value in the strengthening of character. The private citizen, who
conscientiously day by day had carried out the worship of his
household gods and month by month observed the sacred abstinence from
work on the days of festival, was certainly not less fitted to take
his place as a member of a strenuous and well-organised community, or
to serve obediently and quietly in the army on campaign. Even the
magistrate in the execution of his religious duties must have acquired
an exactness and method, which would not be valueless in the conduct
of public business. And when we pass to the origin of this
formalism&mdash;the legal relation&mdash;the connection with the Roman character
becomes at once more obvious. The 'lawgivers of the world,' who
developed constitution and code to a systematised whole such as
antiquity had not dreamed of before, <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>imported, we may say if we like,
their legal notions into the sphere of religion: but we must not
forget the other side of the question. The permanence and success of
this greater contract with higher powers&mdash;the feeling that the gods
did regard and reward exact fulfilment of duty&mdash;cannot have been
without re-action on the relations of the life of the community: it
was, as it were, a higher sanction to the legal point of view: a
pledge that the relations of citizen and state too were rightly
conceived. 'There is,' says Cicero, speaking of the death of Clodius
in the language of a later age, 'there is a divine power which
inspired that criminal to his own ruin: it was not by chance that he
expired before the shrine of the Bona Dea, whose rites he had
violated': the divine justice is the sanction of the human law. Even
in the fear, from which all ultimately sprang, there was a training in
self-repression and self-subordination, which in a more civilised age
must result in a valuable respect and obedience. The descendants of
those who had made religion out of an attempt to appease the hostile
<i>numina</i>, feeling themselves not indeed on more familiar terms with
their 'unknown gods,' but only perhaps a little more confident of
their own strength, <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>were not likely to be wanting in a disciplined
sense of dependence and an appreciation of the value of respect for
authority, which alone can give stability to a constitution. If fear
with the Romans was not the beginning of theological wisdom, it was
yet an important contribution to the character of a disciplined state.</p>

<p>But, as I have hinted in the course of this sketch more than once, the
answer to this problem, as well as the key to the general
understanding of the Roman religion, is to be found in the worship of
the household. If we knew more of it, we should see more clearly where
religion and morality joined hands, but we know enough to give us a
clue. There not only are the principal events of life, birth,
adolescence, marriage, attended by their religious sanction, but in
the ordinary course of the daily round the divine presence and the
dependence of man are continually emphasised. The gods are given their
portion of the family meal, the sanctified dead are recalled to take
their share of the family blessings. The result was not merely an
approach&mdash;collectively, not individually&mdash;to that sense of the
nearness of the unseen, which has so great an effect on the actions of
the living, but a very strong bond of family union which <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>lay at the
root of the life of the state. It would be difficult to find a clearer
expression of the notion than in the fact that the same word <i>pietas</i>,
which expresses the due fulfilment of man's duty to god, is also the
ideal of the relations of the members of a household: filial piety
was, in fact, but another aspect of that rightness of relation, which
reveals itself in the worship of the gods. No doubt that, in the
city-life of later periods, this ideal broke down on both sides:
household worship was neglected and family life became less dutiful.
But it was still, especially in the country, the true backbone of
Roman society, and no one can read the opening odes of Horace's third
book without feeling the strength of Augustus' appeal to it.</p>

<p>And if we translate this, as we have learned to do, into terms of the
state, we can get some idea of what the Romans meant by their debt to
their religion. As the household was bound together by the tie of
common worship, as in the intermediate stage the clan, severed
politically and socially, yet felt itself reunited in the gentile
rites, so too the state was welded into a whole by the regularly
recurring annual festivals and the assurance of the divine sanction on
its undertakings. It might be that in the course of time <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>these rites
lost their meaning and the community no longer by personal presence
expressed its service to the gods, but the cult stood there still, as
the type of Rome's union to the higher powers and a guarantee of their
assistance against all foes: the religion of Rome was, as it has been
said, the sanctification of patriotism&mdash;the Roman citizen's highest
moral ideal. It has been remarked, perhaps with partial truth, that
the religion of the <i>&AElig;neid</i>&mdash;in many ways a summary of Roman thought
and feeling&mdash;is the belief in the <i>fata Romae</i> and their fulfilment.
The very impersonality of this conception makes it a good picture of
what religion was in the Roman state. It was not, as with the Jews, a
strong conviction of the rightness of their own belief and a certainty
that their divine protectors must triumph over those of other nations,
but a feeling of the constant presence of some spirits, who, 'if haply
they might find them,' would, on the payment of their due, bear their
part in the great progress of right and justice and empire on which
Rome must march to her victory. It was the duty of the citizen, with
this conception of his city before his eyes, to see to it that the
state's part in the contract was fulfilled. From his ancestors had
been inherited the tradition, which told him the when, <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>where, and
how, and in the preservation of that tradition and its due performance
consisted at once Rome's duty and her glory. 'If we wish,' says
Cicero, 'to compare ourselves with other nations, we may be found in
other respects equal or even inferior; in religion, that is in the
worship of the gods, we are far superior.' The religion of Rome may
not have advanced the theology or the ethics of the world, but it made
and held together a nation.</p>

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
